The idea is to  occupying the mind with something simple, repetitive, and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep.\\nThis practice has become deeply ingrained into popular culture\\'s notion of sleep.

It describes a feeling of euphoric tingling and relaxation that can come over someone when he or she hears certain sounds or triggers. \\nWhat are these sounds? It might surprise you, but the sounds are of people doing very simple, quiet, calming tasks, such as folding towels, brushing their hair, or flipping magazine pages.  Audio clips often consist of voices whispering nice things like \"You are appreciated\", or contain the sound of tapping, scratching, or rain.\\nMany people describe the feeling as “tingles” that run through the back of someone’s head and spine. Others say the feeling is deeply relaxing, and can cause them to fall asleep.\\nThe feeling isn’t normally sexual. Although some people are triggered by sounds that appear sexual, other people say that the tingles and feelings of relaxation have nothing to do with sex. \\nSUPPORT\\nFor questions or feedback please email hello@topvoiceapps.com ..... if it takes a little while for us to get back to you, it means we\\'ve fallen asleep to our ASMR sounds :)')\n",
