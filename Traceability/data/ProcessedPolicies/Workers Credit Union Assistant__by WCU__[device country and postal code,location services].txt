important information for users of amazon's alexa service
this alexa agreement is between you and workers credit union, (“workers cu” or “us” or “we”), governs your use of the workers credit union banking skill on amazon’s alexa service on any alexa-enabled device (the “skill”)
the agreement applies in addition to, and is not intended to replace, any other agreement govern your accounts at workers credit union
before using the skill, please read these terms and conditions, the workers cu privacy policy , the workers cu digital banking user agreement , and the workers cu terms and conditions (collectively, the “agreement”)
your use of the skill is conditioned on your acceptance of this agreement
if you don’t accept these terms, you may not use the skill
the skill allows you to use your alexa-enabled device to communicate with workers cu, by voice, regarding your account(s)
your voice is only used to activate alexa’s features and is not used to authenticate the account
to use the skill, you will have to speak commands and questions aloud to amazon’s alexa service (“alexa”), and you will receive responses aloud
any communication to workers cu via alexa will be treated by workers cu as a communication authorized by you, and any communication from workers cu via alexa in response to a request received from your alexa-enabled device will be treated by workers cu as a communication to you
in other words, you are responsible for all the interactions with workers cu via the skill
for example, it is possible that someone other than you could interact with workers cu via the skill, or that someone could overhear you interacting with workers cu via the skill and learn information about your account(s)
(try using your “inside voice
”) it is also possible that alexa (and the equipment alexa is installed on) and/or amazon will record your interactions with the skill or with alexa
consult your agreements with amazon to learn more about how amazon and your alexa-enabled device treat those interactions
once you set up your alexa device with the skill, you are authorizing workers cu to provide information to the device based on the device’s security settings
for example, the settings on your device may allow the device to retrieve information about your account(s) based on only verbal requests from anyone who uses your device, or to save information about your account(s) for easier access
by enabling the skill on your alexa-enabled device, you are responsible for how the skill is used (including any communication to or from workers cu from your device)
we didn’t design or manufacture alexa or your alexa-enabled device
the device also runs other software (e
, alexa and other third-party apps) that we did not write or design and do not have control over
it’s possible that alexa will not hear you correctly, will incorrectly translate what you said, or even say something to you different than the information we provided to alexa
by accepting this agreement, you understand and agree that workers cu is not responsible for inaccuracies in your interactions with workers cu via the skill
if you have any issues or doubts about the accuracy of your interactions with workers cu via the skill, you can still get your account details by using the workers cu mobile application or logging on to your account(s) on our website at wcu
we are making the skill available as part of a limited, early pilot program
it’s possible that there will be bugs
in addition to the possibility of alexa mishearing you or misquoting us, there’s also a possibility that something might not work correctly or might not work at all
by getting this special preview and using the skill, you’re accepting that risk
again, you do not need the skill to access to your account(s)
all of the information available from workers cu via the skill is also available the old-fashioned ways (see “accuracy” section, above)
don’t rely on the skill as your sole means of accessing your account(s)
electronic records and signatures
by accepting these terms, you consent to the general use of electronic records and signatures in our relationship with you
hardware and other requirements
to participate in this pilot and access workers cu via the skill, you must (1) have an active account, (2) be enrolled in workers cu online banking with your account, (3) be an 18 years of age or older (4) have an alexa-enabled device, an internet connection, and an amazon account
you cannot use the skill otherwise
release of your information to amazon
your interactions with workers cu via the skill are subject to the workers cu privacy policy
by installing the skill, you are authorizing workers cu to perform the actions and/or share with amazon the information communicated to workers cu, or requested from workers cu
we’re going to send that information through amazon, which will then go through the internet
for example, if you request that alexa tell you your balance on your workers cu checking account, you authorize workers cu to release that information to amazon
the purpose of the pilot is to give workers cu customers early access to test and provide feedback
we may seek your constructive feedback on the skill, including problems you encounter, aspects that work well, and suggestions for improving it
you agree that workers cu may email you from time to time about your experience with the skill
we may change, suspend, or discontinue the skill, or any part of it, at any time without notice
we may amend any of this agreement’s terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on our website at wcu
your continued use of the skill after the effective date of the revised agreement constitutes acceptance of the terms
your rights under this agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms
in case of such termination, we may immediately revoke your access to the skill
during your participation in the pilot, workers cu may or may not provide technical and other support for the skill
you agree to abide by any support rules and policies
if such support is provided, it will be provided in addition to any normal support for your account(s) and will be available exclusively through the pilot while you are a participant
you acknowledge and agree that all use of the skill is at your sole risk
you assume all risk for your use of the skill, that it is provided ”as is”, and that workers cu makes no warranty or representation, either express or implied
workers cu expressly disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement
no advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from workers cu, or through or from the skill, will create any warranty of any kind
this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the commonwealth of massachusetts without regard to any portion of its choice of law principles that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction’s law
provided, however, that to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws
workers cu trademarks and graphics used in connection with the skill are the property of workers cu
all other trademarks and graphics used are the property of their respective owners
