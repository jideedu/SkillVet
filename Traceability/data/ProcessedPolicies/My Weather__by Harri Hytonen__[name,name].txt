my weather skill privacy policy
your privacy is valued, so i want to be explicit about what kind of personal information is involved when you interact with my weather
my weather skill allows you to add 'places' where weather observations and forecasts will be created for
a place consists of place name and address (see this guide )
you can also decide at what accuracy the address is given
all places will be persisted together with alexa user id so that places can later be found by the skill by using the user id as a key
only my weather skill can access this data provided that the request contains a valid user id
persisted places are not used for any other purpose
no other data is persisted by the skill
any feedback is welcome to
