vital signs has been submitted for certification
on the google assistant platform under the name “welby’s vital
signs” (google said the invocation “vital signs” by itself was
too generic, so we’ll wait to see if the new name is acceptable
pending successful outcome of google’s tests, you’ll soon be able
to access the “action” – google’s equivalent name for alexa
“skills” – on your google devices
vital signs can now compute statistics for your
various health metrics, e
min value, max value, average, etc
get stats for all of your data, simply ask the tool to “analyze
the tool will generate stats for each health metric
these metrics are stored under separate columns
within your history file
to get stats for just a particular metric,
provide the column # for that field within your history file, e
“analyze data for column two”, or simply “analyze column two”
many thanks to all of you who are using vital signs, and providing
as a result of your feedback, the following new features
please keep those suggestions coming
cases when you don’t know what value to enter in a particular
field, or just want to leave the field blank, you can now say "skip"
when prompted for input
skill/action also recognizes utterances such as "blank",
no value will be populated in
csv file for that entry
you are sharing a common device with others, you can now enter a
first name as an input field within a custom script in order to
differentiate among lines in your history
for example, you can begin the script with
you can now upload an arbitrary results file to replace the version
currently stored in your account
you do this the same way as
uploading a new script or plot routine, i
just send an email to welbydx@gmail
"data" appears somewhere in the subject line, and the body
of the email contains the new csv contents
you can now specify what health metrics you’d like vital signs to
track, and you can even make your own plots too
when you enter data
into the skill/action, vital signs follows a “script” to prompt
here’s the default script
what is your "temperature", in degrees fahrenheit
what is your "respiration rate", in breaths per minute
what is your "pulse", in beats per minute
what is your "blood pressure"
can now replace that script with one of your own, simply by sending
an email to welbydx@gmail
com and including the word “script” somewhere in the subject line
for example, here’s an email that changes the script to one that
tracks your current weight and how many calories you’ve recently
new vital signs script
what is your current "weight" in pounds
what is your latest
vital signs uses the words enclosed “in quotes” to build the
confirmation message after you enter all of your data
are also used as the column headings in your report
you specify a header line at the end of the script starting with a
in the example above you might end the script with the
addition to specifying the health metrics you’d like vital signs to
track, you can also design a custom plot for your data
uses gnuplot to produce its
you can replace the default gnuplot code in the same manner
simply email a new version of the code to welbydx@gmail
com , but this
time specify the word “plot” somewhere in the subject line
example, here’s an email that plots the pounds & calories data
collected by the script above
new vital signs plot code

vital signs is an alexa
skill – and soon to be a google action – that maintains a
history of your primary
vital signs – body temperature, respiration rate, pulse, and
blood pressure – and emails you a file and chart of this data
whenever you request it
to use vital signs, do the following
first, enable the skill/action on your amazon /google
second, grant the skill/action permission to
access your first name and the email address associated with your
vital signs uses these to communicate with
you during various dialogue interactions
for alexa devices, open the alexa app – or
com – then select
manage permissions, and turn on the requested
for google devices, the action will talk you
through the steps to link your account
finally, ask alexa/google to “talk to vital
signs”, and create your account
vital signs understands the following commands
set up your initial vital signs account
prompt you for your current vital signs
your blood pressure (expressed as number “ over” number ),
your pulse (in beats per minute), your respiration rate (in breaths
per minute), and finally, your body temperature in degrees
(expressed as number “ point” number )
data” will provide stats on the data you've entered, one health metric at
include the minimum and maximum values for the metric, the median,
the average, and the standard deviation
metrics are stored under
separate columns within the history file
to get stats for just a
particular metric, provide the column # for the metric as part of
“analyze data for column two”, or simply
will email you a file (csv format) with your vital
sign history, as well as a graph of the data
samples of each of
these are provided below
in addition to your own data, you’ll
also receive the vital sign history file and graph for any user who
has identified you as their proxy
see below for more information
“ erase data” will clear out your
entire vital sign history
“ update proxies ” will email you
instructions for how to add or delete a proxy on your account
“ delete account” will completely
remove your vital signs account, any data stored under the account,
and all of your proxy assignments
we’ve all been in situations where we’d like
to know how someone is doing, but we can’t be around to check on
the vital signs proxy feature is meant to handle this
say mary is currently a vital signs user, and john – mary’s son –
would like to access mary’s data
here’s how john (with mary’s
permission) can do this
first, john needs to create his own vital
john may not be interested in recording/tracking his
own vital signs, but he still needs to have an account if he wants
to read his mom’s data
next, mary needs to give john permission to
access her data, i
she must designate john as a proxy
this, mary opens vital signs, and tells the assistant she wants to
update her proxy info
the tool then sends mary an email message
that lists her current proxies, and gives instructions for sending a
reply that adds (or deletes) a proxy on her account
submits a reply adding john as a proxy
afterwards, mary can ask
vital signs to resend her proxy info, so she can confirm that john
has been added to her proxy list
lastly, once john has been named as mary’s
proxy, then whenever he asks vital signs to send a report, the tool
will send john both his own data, as well has his mom’s
there is no limit on the number of proxies a user
can associate with his/her account
thus, for example, if mary had
other children she could make all of them proxies
is no restriction on the number of times a single user can be named
as a proxy for someone else
so, for example, if john also wants to
keep tabs on his dad, jim, then jim can also name john as a proxy on

i’ve been interested in math and computer
science ever since earning degrees in these fields almost 40 years
later, i acquired an interest in medicine after being diagnosed
with a condition called “ lynch
syndrome ” which predisposes me to a whole assortment of
vital signs is my attempt to integrate all of these diverse
interests in the development of a modern voice assistant
those of us who’ve been diagnosed with any sort
of chronic medical condition like to keep close tabs on our health,
and stay on the lookout for early warning signs of disease
diagnostic tests require a doctor’s prescription, so they’re not
directly accessible to patients
hence, patients like myself try to
make best use of tests and data that is within our reach
data is generally termed “ patient-generated
health data (pghd) ”
unfortunately, health metrics that are
readily available to patients oftentimes aren’t the most sensitive
or specific indicators of complex disease
it is my hope and belief,
in artificial intelligence/machine learning (ai/ml) may start to
change this, as new insights are gleaned from data that had
previously been under analyzed
not everyone may share my enthusiasm for tracking
what portion of the population are interested in
collecting and recording their health data
what are the best metrics
is voice assistant technology the right platform for
if people do embrace voice assistants for this purpose, how
well will they adhere to a regular reporting schedule
questions that vital signs may help to answer
this privacy notice applies to both the vital
signs alexa skill and google action
in general it covers
what personally identifiable information
(pii) is collected while using the skill/action, how it is used, and
with whom it is shared
the security controls in place to protect
how you can administer your information
information collection & sharing
vital signs is intended for personal use
information you share with the tool – your first name, email
address, and vital sign data – is not sold or shared with any other
public or private entity
only you, your designated proxies, and
myself (as system administrator) have access to the data
a variety of security controls have been
implemented to protect your data
your vital sign information is stored on a
virtual private server (vps) that is physically hosted and secured
by amazon web services (aws)
the vital signs account on the vps is locked
down so it is only accessible to the system administrator (me)
your name and email address are stored as
clear text on the server, but your vital sign history file is
encrypted on disk using the linux ccrypt utility
the encryption key is not stored locally, but is passed to
the server by the skill/action
whenever your data is transmitted across a
during http and smtp sessions), it is encrypted using
the tool uses gmail to send/receive email
all email folders associated with the administrator account are
if at any time you’d like to remove your
information from the system, simply ask the skill/action to erase
your data, which removes just your history file, or to delete your
account, which removes everything about you
address, and vital sign history
it’s worth saying a word about hipaa
stands for the “health insurance portability and accountability
it’s a law passed back in 1996 that mandates certain data
privacy and security provisions to safeguard medical information
does hipaa apply to information that a patient submits to a health
app like vital signs, and if so, how
thankfully, the department of
health and human services has already considered this scenario, and published
guidelines on their website to assist app developers
to those guidelines, vital signs is not subject to hipaa regulations
here’s an excerpt from the guidelines
health app to her smartphone
she populates it with her own
for example, the consumer inputs blood glucose levels
and blood pressure readings she obtained herself using home health
based on the facts
presented in the scenario, is app developer a hipaa business
creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health
information (phi) on behalf of a covered entity or another business
the consumer is using the developer’s app to help her
manage and organize her information without any involvement of her
i’d appreciate your feedback on the tool
free to email me your comments at welbydx@gmail
for those who are interested, you can also take a look at the code
that implements the skill/action on my github
