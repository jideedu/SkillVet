information from third-party social media platforms
you may be able to choose to register, log-on, or enhance your profile on the service through a third-party social media platform, such as facebook connect

more about ip addresses
your ip address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the internet
depending on how you connect to the internet, your ip address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the internet
ip addresses do not include your name, email address or other personal information, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you
for example, if you have registered with the service, we may link your ip address to account information that identifies you personally
we may also provide your ip address to our third-party service providers who can use it to identify information such as your state and zip code
if we suspect inappropriate or criminal activity or a threat to the service or their users, we may also share our server logs—which contain users’ ip addresses—with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals
cookies and similar technologies
most websites use cookies and/or similar technologies to place information about a user’s visit to that website in a small data text file that is stored on the user’s computer

collect information about the ways visitors use the service—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page
support the features and functionality of the service—for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits
personalize your experience when you use the service, including by serving targeted advertisements

if, however, you have created a user account, we may link the information we collect using these web technologies to other information that identifies you personally

information about third-party cookies and interest-based advertising

in addition, we may serve ads on third-party services (such as facebook) that are targeted to reach users on those services who are also listed in one or more of our databases (“matched list ads”)
