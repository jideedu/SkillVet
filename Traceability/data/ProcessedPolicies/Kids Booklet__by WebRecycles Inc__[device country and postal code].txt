children's privacy is important to amazon
this disclosure and the amazon privacy notice describe how we handle personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 ("child" or "children")
what personal information does amazon collect from children
we offer some services intended for children, and in some cases we may know a child is using our services (for example, when using a child profile)
in these situations, children may share and we may collect personal information that requires verifiable parental consent under the children's online privacy protection act (collectively, "child personal information")
child personal information could include, for example, name, birthdate, contact information (including phone numbers and e-mail addresses), voice, photos, videos, location, and certain activity and device information and identifiers (such as cookies, device serial numbers, and ip addresses)
our privacy notice describes other information we collect that is not child personal information
how does amazon use child personal information
we use child personal information to provide and improve our products and services, including personalizing offerings and recommendations for children, communicating information, enforcing parental controls, and giving parents visibility into how their children use our products and services
we will not serve interest-based ads to your child when they are using an amazon child profile
does amazon share child personal information
we share child personal information only as described in our privacy notice
your child may be able to share information publicly and with others depending on the products and services used

if you have not given us permission to collect child personal information, we may make available certain voice services intended for children (e
, certain alexa features), and we may process your child’s voice recordings to provide these services, but we will not store those voice recordings
we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose child personal information without this permission
we make available controls so that you can remain involved in your child's use of amazon services
