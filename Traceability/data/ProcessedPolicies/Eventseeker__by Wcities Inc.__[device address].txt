This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 1st 2018
Welcome to the eventseeker website and mobile application (the “Site”) of Wcities
(“Wcities”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”)
This Site is operated by Wcities and has been created to provide information about our company and its information services (the “Services”) to our users (“you”, “your”)
This Privacy Policy sets forth Wcities’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services
When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below
Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, name and email address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys
Wherever Wcities collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy
If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Wcities and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States
Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data
When you interact with Wcities through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information
Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you
Wcities may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Wcities affiliates, agents or service providers
This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Wcities Service
Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Wcities often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us
This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis
Wcities may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally
Wcities may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes
In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies
" A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately
For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission
We do not use tracking cookies in any circumstances
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features
Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Wcities uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy
If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided
For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem
Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services
Wcities and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Services
Wcities and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you
If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications
Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications
In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below
If Wcities intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected
Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Wcities is not in the business of selling your information
We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you
There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties
Wcities, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions
Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments
When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function
Wcities may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Wcities, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability
You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data
If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Wcities other than Personal Data collected through the Site or Services
This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Wcities through this Site or through any other means
This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively, “Public Areas”), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”)
All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Wcities shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution
Wcities does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13
If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site
We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Wcities through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases
Links to Other Web Sites
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site
This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Wcities (the “Third Party Sites”)
The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites
The links from this Site do not imply that Wcities endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites
We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies
Integrating Third Party Services within the Services
One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party services, such as social media, ticketing services and networking services (“Third Party Services”) to be directly integrated into your Wcities experience
By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized by providing relevant location based services based on music you listen to, or people you follow
To take advantage of this feature, we may ask you to authorize Wcities to access the Third Party Services
By enabling Third Party Services, you are allowing us to pass your login information to these services providers for these purposes, but at no time does Wcities store or view such login information
When you add a Third Party Service account to the Service, we will collect other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service
Please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and Wcities shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled within the Service
Wcities takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction
However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way
Other Terms and Conditions
Your access to and use of this Site is subject to the Terms of Service
