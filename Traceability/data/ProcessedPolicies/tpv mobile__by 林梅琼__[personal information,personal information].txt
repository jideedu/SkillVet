our privacy policy explains
what information we collect and why we collect it
how we use that information
we collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which youtube videos you might like
we collect information in the following ways
information you give us
for example, many of our services require you to sign up for a google account
when you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account
if you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible google profile, which may include your name and photo
information we get from your use of our services
we collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on youtube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content
information we collect when you are signed in to google, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your google account
when information is associated with your google account, we treat it as personal information
for more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your google account, visit the transparency and choice section of this policy
how we use information we collect
we use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect google and our users
we also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads
we may use the name you provide for your google profile across all of the services we offer that require a google account
in addition, we may replace past names associated with your google account so that you are represented consistently across all our services
if other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible google profile information, such as your name and photo
if you have a google account, we may display your profile name, profile photo, and actions you take on google or on third-party applications connected to your google account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts
we will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your google account
when you contact google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing
we may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements
we use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services
one of the products we use to do this on our own services is google analytics
for example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer
when showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health
our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection
we may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know
depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve google’s services and the ads delivered by google
we will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this privacy policy
