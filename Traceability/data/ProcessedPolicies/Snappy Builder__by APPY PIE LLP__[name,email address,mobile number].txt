policy in effect from march 02, 2020
the following privacy policy governs appypie
com website and all content, services and products available at or through the website (collectively, the “service”)
the service is owned and operated by appy pie llp, a limited liability partnership incorporated in new delhi, india under the llp act, 2008 having llpin aaf-5370 and having its principal place of business at 165, nsez noida, 201305 india (hereinafter referred to as the “ap”, which expression shall mean and include its heirs, successors and permitted assigns)
ap currently uses third parties to accept payments (hereinafter a “third-party payment processor”)
subscribers will make all payments to ap using this third-party payment processor, which are currently appy pie llc in the usa & appy pie ltd in the uk, and which may be changed/updated by client in writing
ap has the right to change the third-party payment processor or to cease using a third-party payment processor at any time
despite any similarity in name, there is no affiliation between the third-party payment processor and ap, and the third-party payment processor is not a party to this agreement
the service is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, ap’s privacy policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this site by ap (collectively, “ap”)
ap operates several websites including appypie
com (the “websites”), as well as a number of mobile applications on behalf of our customers (collectively, the “applications”)
it is ap’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and applications
this policy describes how ap collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal information you provide
it also describes your choices regarding the use, access, and correction of your personal information
your privacy is critically important to us
at ap we have a few fundamental principles
we don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it
(we can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason
) we don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights
we don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services
in our social networking and mobile application products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted
eu data transfer mechanism gdpr applies primarily to controllers and processors located in the european economic area or eea and if the personal data is transferred out of the eea, there is a risk of losing gdpr protection
it is for this reason that gdpr restricts the transfer of personal data outside the eea, unless the rights of the individuals are protected in some way
until recently there were two ways to do this – eu-us privacy shield and standard contractual clauses
in a recent development, however, the court of justice of the european union invalidated the eu-us privacy shield framework for transfer of data
however, standard contractual clauses are still valid as a tool or mechanism for data transfer to processors outside of the eu, switzerland or the uk
at appy pie, we have standard contractual clauses (sccs) in place for transfer of data so that all personal data is protected
we, at appy pie, are committed to enable our customers to provide customer service responsibly by implementing and adhering to prescribed compliance policies, both as a data controller and processor
passive collection as is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically
this information may include internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (isp), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e
html pages, graphics, etc
), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site
gathering of personal information certain visitors to ap’s websites and users of ap’s applications choose to interact with ap in ways that require ap to gather personal information
the amount and type of information that ap gathers depend on the nature of the interaction

in each case, ap collects such information only when it is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ap, for example your name, address and phone number where needed
ap does not disclose personal information other than as described below, and visitors can always refuse to supply personal information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related and application-related activities
