i have a number of features built around dungeons and dragons that are just for fun and free to use
for example, i have a character sheet function designed for groups
it's something i'm building for my friends but anyone can use it
if you play dungeons & dragons please also check out the dark citadel
choose-your-own-adventure rpg game on alexa with a lot of features like combat, skill checks, and other things built into a fantasy world
in the near future i'm planning on
releasing gumshoe detective agency (thriller/detective stories), haunted house (horror), and last light in the dark (space action/horror) using the same system
if you're looking for somewhere to start with my books, consider either the ninth circle for an action packed short novella
that will kick off both the world on fire
and world of shadows series
i like action stories that are fun to read, so that's what i try to write
