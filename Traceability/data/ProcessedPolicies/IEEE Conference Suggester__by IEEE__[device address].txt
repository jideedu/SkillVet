technical and regulatory information
ieee automatically records the internet protocol (ip) addresses of visitors
the ip address is a unique number assigned to every computer on the internet
generally, an ip address changes each time you connect to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address)
note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, the ip address that we collect may contain information that could be deemed identifiable
this is because, with some broadband connections, your ip address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer
as well as recording the ip addresses of users, ieee may also keep track of sites that users visited immediately prior to visiting ieee's website and the search terms they used to find it
we keep track of the pages visited on ieee's website, the amount of time spent on those pages and the types of searches done on them
your searches remain confidential and anonymous
ieee uses this information only for statistical purposes to find out which pages users find most useful and to improve the website
ieee also captures and stores information that you transmit

ieee uses both session-based cookies (which last only for the duration of the user's session) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device and provides information about the session you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again)
these cookies and web beacons provide useful information to ieee, enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance the usage of our websites on all ieee web servers
tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable non-core functionalities on the ieee website and enable third-party functions (such as a social media "share" link)
we may also include web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages to determine whether the messages have been opened
do not track (dnt)
the online advertising industry has self-regulatory initiatives designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all of the companies participating in these programs
our websites do not respond to dnt consumer browser settings
ieee has appointed and mandated a privacy officer who represents the regulatory authorities inside the ieee organization, and in return represents the ieee organization to regulatory authorities
