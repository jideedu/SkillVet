posted on 12 june, 2019 by octaviomenocal92
this privacy policy describes how quick maths protects and makes use of the information you give the company when you use alexa skills
to use the skill, it requires that you speak to alexa, and responses will be received aloud
therefore, any communication to alexa will be treated by quick maths as a communication authorized by you, and any communication via the alexa skill in response to a request received from alexa will be treated by quick maths as a communication to you
you are responsible for all of the interactions with the alexa skill
for this reason, it is imperative that you consult the agreements that you have in place with alexa to ensure that you are using alexa skills safely and correctly
once you set up your alexa skill, you are authorizing alexa to provide information to the skill
this means that you are responsible for how the alexa skill is used, including any communication to or from the skill itself
to prevent unauthorized disclosure or access to your information, we rely on amazon’s (alexa’s) physical and electronic security safeguards
quick maths does not share personal information
we may change, suspend, or discontinue the skill, or any part of it, at any time without notice
this policy is updated from time to time
your continued use of the skill after the effective date of the revised terms constitutes acceptance of the terms
