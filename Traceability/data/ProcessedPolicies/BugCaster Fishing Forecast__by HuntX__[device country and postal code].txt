privacy policy for bugcaster/da fish
this privacy policy describes how huntx protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data
before using any of our alexa skills, please read this policy and our alexa skills terms of use, as well as the alexa terms of use and the privacy policies by the amazon digital services llc (with its affiliates, “amazon”)
regarding amazon, “alexa” means their alexa voice service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related software
if you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy
when you use our skills you have to talk to alexa
this voice input is sent to amazon and us where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you
this is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer
we never collect or share personal data with our skills
to improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics
this is done automatically by amazon in the amazon developer portal
no user-specific identifying information is ever saved or logged and we only ask for the user zip code and country so that we may provide the fishing forecast for that area
our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time
further, this privacy policy might change
you can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the alexa app or in the alexa store
your continued use of our skill after changes of the privacy policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both
