if you make any requests regarding access to or removal of your information pursuant to this privacy policy, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring your user id or other personal information associated with your account
so we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase " personally identifiable information " in this privacy policy, we mean personally identifiable information as that term is described in us privacy law and pipeda, namely, information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including, your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, as well as any other information that permits you to be contacted physically or online
when we use the phrase " anonymous information " in this privacy policy, we mean information that does not allow for the identification of an individual or is not associated with or linked to that person’s personally identifiable information
anonymous information does not enable identification of or contact with individuals
please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will collect, use, share, protect or otherwise handle it
if you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not download the app, register with our services, or otherwise use our services, the app, the website or the atom platform
by using our services, you agree to this privacy policy
this privacy policy may change from time to time, as detailed below
children’s use of atom tickets’ service and the atom platform
protecting the privacy of children is very important to us
our services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our services
if you are 13 years of age or older, but under 18 years of age, you may only use our services with the involvement of a parent or guardian
we do not specifically market to individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, we do not collect or maintain personally identifiable information from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our services is designed to attract individuals under 13 years of age
if we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's personally identifiable information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the services
if you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under 13 years of age, please contact us
types of information atom tickets collects about you, and how it’s collected
in general, there are two types of information we collect about you – personally identifiable information and anonymous information, as defined above
in general, the personally identifiable information we collect enables us to provide our services and use of the atom platform to you and make our services more relevant and useful to you and others
we also collect personally identifiable information that you submit to us voluntarily, for example, at registration, when you sign up for e-mail or text notifications, through your claiming or using special offers, in the course of your use of our services and the atom platform, when you respond to surveys, and when you otherwise communicate directly with us
to use certain features of the services, we require you to create an " account " by providing your name, phone number, e-mail and/or a password
when you purchase tickets or concessions, we will collect all information necessary to process the transaction
through your use of the services, we may also collect additional information, including your ip address
in addition, the services may access your device’s image storage applications and contacts, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the services
when you communicate with us or otherwise interact with publicly available areas of our services and the atom platform, including posting comments, ratings, or reviews, we will collect and store any information that is contained in your communications and/or comments (“ public postings ”)
any information you choose to provide when using the services should reflect how much you want other users to know about you
you can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the services and the atom platform you are able to use
as you use the atom platform, we may collect location-based information from you through your mobile or other location-aware device
certain of our services are location-specific and can provide helpful information based on where you are
if you consent to telling us where you are (i
, by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may use that information to provide you with location-based information
if you want to deactivate this feature, you can disable location services on your mobile device, but we will not be able to provide those services
please contact your carrier for more information
when we collect your personally identifiable information, we may automatically associate that information and information that we collect with your account so that we can identify you across multiple devices, browsers, and networks
we may also obtain information about you from a third-party data aggregator, cookie technology operator, advertising network, or other form of data company
please remember that others may have access to your device
to protect your privacy, you should always log out from the atom platform after using any shared devices
limits on collection of personally identifiable information
we will not collect personally identifiable information indiscriminately, but will limit our collection of personally identifiable information to that which is reasonable and necessary to perform the services
we will also collect personally identifiable information as authorized by law
information collected from you about others
if you use our services to purchase tickets for others, share your plans with others, or invite others to use our services, you can choose to provide us with the names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and contact profile photographs of those individuals
by doing so, you represent and warrant that any contact information you provide is accurate and current and that you have obtained any consents from your contacts that are necessary for us to access and upload the information you provide and to send your contacts any information and messages that you choose to initiate through our services, including via e-mail and text message or short message service messages (“sms”) number
you or the third party may contact us at privacy@atomtickets
com to request the removal of this information from our database
unless we have independently obtained the personally identifiable information of an individual identified in your contacts (for example, if such person has independently used our services), our use of such information from your contacts, with your consent and representation that you have obtained any necessary consent from your contacts, shall be limited to facilitating your use of the services
information collected through social networking services and other third-parties
we may create interfaces that allow you to connect with a social networking service (" sns "), such as facebook, through our services, or other third-parties
we work with the sns’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer api) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that sns on your behalf
in order to provide this authorization, you do not provide us with your user name or password to the sns, but you will need to log-in to that sns directly through our services
once authorized by you, the sns provides us a token that allows the sns to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information
for example, when you click "connect" to grant us access to your facebook account, we will import your name and other information from facebook and, as you use our services, we may periodically check for updates to such information
you can revoke our access to any sns at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable sns
similarly, if you interact with us through a social media function (such as, for example, “liking” a facebook post or a tweet), you may be permitting us to have access to certain of your information from your sns profile pursuant to the terms of that sns
we collect the following types of anonymous information
information collected by our servers
to make our services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect certain anonymous information from you, including your browser type, operating system, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit
any collected financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e
valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date), is stored by the applicable payment processor or digital wallet entity, such as paypal, amazon payments, braintree payments, etc
you are encouraged to review their policies and contact them directly for responses to your questions
feel free to contact us if you have questions about who the applicable payment processor or digital wallet entity is
as is true of most apps and websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files
this information includes browser type, internet service provider (" isp "), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data
we use this information to analyze trends, to administer the services, to track users’ use of the services, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to better tailor our services to our users’ needs
for example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information tailored to your interests
like many online services, we use cookies to collect information
the cookies (" cookies ") are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s or device’s hard drive while you are viewing the website
we may use both session cookies (which expire once you close the web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our services
this type of information is collected to make the services (and those of third parties) more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us to address your special interests and needs
if you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites or apps you visit
consult your browser’s technical information
if you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all of the services or access certain features of the services
if you have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let us know by contacting us at privacy@atomtickets
we may collect information about the computer or device you use to access our services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, mac address, advertising device identifier, and mobile network information
in addition, the services may access your device’s image storage applications and contacts, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the services
unless we have independently obtained the personally identifiable information of an individual identified in your contacts (for example, if such person has independently used our services), our use of such information from your contacts, with your consent, shall be limited to facility your use of the services
for more information about how you can control our access to these applications, please see "your choices" below
in addition, we may use pixel tags (" pixel tags ") (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs)
pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of online users
in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in apps and web pages
pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages and in-app advertisements in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened and in-app advertisements viewed to help ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users
we may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user
we may allow third-party advertisers or partners to use pixel tags on the app for the same reasons and in the same methods identified above
we do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users’ personally identifiable information, nor do we provide enough information to third parties for them to do so
collection of information by advertisers
we may use third parties to serve ads on the services
certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to the app and other apps and websites, your isp, your advertising device identifier, and/or the browser you use to visit our services
they do this by using cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies
information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our services and the other sites tracked by these third parties
this privacy policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies
if you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, u
users can click here
info/choices and canadian users can click here
via that link you may, among other things, opt out of certain network advertising programs but, if you do, please note that you will still see advertisements, however they may be less relevant to you

we reserve the right to disclose anonymous information publicly without restriction
we also share anonymous information with advertisers, studio partners, and their related agencies
