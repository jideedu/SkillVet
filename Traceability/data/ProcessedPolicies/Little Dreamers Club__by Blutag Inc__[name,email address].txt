non-personal information ordinarily includes aggregate, summary, or other anonymous data, and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding the popularity of specific pages within the site, or information regarding types of internet browsers used by registered users
“cookies” are small files placed on a user’s computer by a web site in order to facilitate the use of that web site

the company uses non-personal information in a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the performance of the site and service and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous statistics for our benefit or for our business partners
because non-personal information is entirely anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy does not limit our ability to use or disclose non-personal information
we may create non-personal information records from personal information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you

as a necessary part of providing services, we may disclose information collected from you as described in this policy

optional communications from us
we do not maintain responsibility for the manner which third parties use or further disclose personal information collected from you through the site or services, after we have disclosed that information to those third parties

access to personal information collected from you
registered users may access their registration profiles at any time to update personal information contained within that registration profile
subsequent uses or disclosures of information by us will reflect those changes, but we have no ability to update any information previously disclosed to any third party
you may request deletion of your personal information by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements)
when we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives
the site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of personal information in the company's possession and control
for example, whenever the service requests that registered users provide sensitive information, that information is encrypted with industry standard encryption techniques
when you are viewing a secure page within the site, such as our checkout form, an icon of a padlock will appear as “locked” at the bottom of web browsers such as microsoft internet explorer, but the same icon will appear as "unlocked" when the user is just “surfing
” we currently use an encryption program known as “ssl,” or “secure sockets layer
” to learn more about ssl, go to https
credit card authorization requests are sent using the same encryption technology
furthermore, access to personal information is physically restricted within our own offices, so that only certain of our employees are granted access to information as appropriate to perform specific jobs and tasks (e
, performing customer service)
please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal information or non-personal information arising in connection with the theft thereof
likewise, registered users are responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to any services, and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information, if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of a password
