data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the changemystyle
the use of the internet pages of the changemystyle
com is possible without any indication of personal data
however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary
if the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject
the processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the general data protection regulation (gdpr), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the changemystyle

for this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e
the data protection declaration of the changemystyle
com is based on the terms used by the european legislator for the adoption of the general data protection regulation (gdpr)
our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners
to ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used
in this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms
personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”)
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person
data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing
processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction
restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future
profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements
pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person
controller or controller responsible for the processing
controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data
where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by union or member state law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by union or member state law
processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller
recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not
however, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with union or member state law shall not be regarded as recipients
the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing
third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data

data protection provisions about the application and use of jetpack for wordpress
on this website, the controller has integrated jetpack
jetpack is a wordpress plug-in, which provides additional features to the operator of a website based on wordpress
jetpack allows the internet site operator, inter alia, an overview of the visitors of the site
by displaying related posts and publications, or the ability to share content on the page, it is also possible to increase visitor numbers
in addition, security features are integrated into jetpack, so a jetpack-using site is better protected against brute-force attacks
jetpack also optimizes and accelerates the loading of images on the website
the operating company of jetpack plug-ins for wordpress is the automattic inc
, 132 hawthorne street, san francisco, ca 94107, united states
the operating enterprise uses the tracking technology created by quantcast inc
, 201 third street, san francisco, ca 94103, united states
jetpack sets a cookie on the information technology system used by the data subject
the definition of cookies is explained above
with each call-up to one of the individual pages of this internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a jetpack component was integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to submit data through the jetpack component for analysis purposes to automattic
during the course of this technical procedure automattic receives data that is used to create an overview of website visits
the data obtained in this way serves the analysis of the behaviour of the data subject, which has access to the internet page of the controller and is analyzed with the aim to optimize the website
the data collected through the jetpack component is not used to identify the data subject without a prior obtaining of a separate express consent of the data subject
the data comes also to the notice of quantcast
quantcast uses the data for the same purposes as automattic
the data subject can, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies
such an adjustment to the internet browser used would also prevent automattic/quantcast from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject
in addition, cookies already in use by automattic/quantcast may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs
in addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data relating to a use of this internet site that are generated by the jetpack cookie as well as the processing of these data by automattic/quantcast and the chance to preclude any such
for this purpose, the data subject must press the ‘opt-out’ button under the link https
com/opt-out/ which sets an opt-out cookie
the opt-out cookie set with this purpose is placed on the information technology system used by the data subject
if the cookies are deleted on the system of the data subject, then the data subject must call up the link again and set a new opt-out cookie
with the setting of the opt-out cookie, however, the possibility exists that the websites of the controller are not fully usable anymore by the data subject
the applicable data protection provisions of automattic may be accessed under https
the applicable data protection provisions of quantcast can be accessed under https
legal basis for the processing
a gdpr serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose
if the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on article 6(1) lit
the same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services
is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on art
in rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person
this would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party
then the processing would be based on art
finally, processing operations could be based on article 6(1) lit
this legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data
such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the european legislator
he considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 gdpr)
the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
where the processing of personal data is based on article 6(1) lit
f gdpr our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders
period for which the personal data will be stored
the criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period
after expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract
provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement
requirement necessary to enter into a contract
obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data
possible consequences of failure to provide such data
we clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e
tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e
information on the contractual partner)
sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us
the data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her
the non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded
before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee
the employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data
existence of automated decision-making
as a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling
