we will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights
•	we ensure transfers within active will be covered by an agreement entered into by active entities (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each such entity to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within active
•	where we transfer your personal information outside active or to third parties who help provide our services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information
or •	where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information are disclosed

how we protect and store personal information
we have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction, or loss, or unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned, including
•	(where appropriate) password protection, encryption, and use of secure communication transmission software (known as "transport layer security" or "tls") to protect our sites
•	placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and service providers
•	destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected
and •	following strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it
whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal information, no transmission over the internet can ever be guaranteed to be secure
therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the internet to us and any such transmission is at your own risk
as the security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password
you should never share your log-in information with others
we are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity
storing your personal information
we will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this policy
where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner
in some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements
in specific circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings
