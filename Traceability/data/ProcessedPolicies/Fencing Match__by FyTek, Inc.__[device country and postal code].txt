we value your privacy, so we want to be explicit about what kind of personal information is involved when you interact with fytek
this page is for the fytek site/apps as a whole
our website and apps as such do not collect any personally identifying information from users
however, instances of fytek that serve a particular region may save log and other information, some of which is personally identifiable
each instance should have its own privacy policy, linked from its home page
fytek apps there are a few apps for iphone and some alexa apps we currently provide
the exact mechanisms for generating the id are as follows
iphone - the app instance generates a random id not based on the phone's unique device identifier (udid)
this id also resets if you re-install the fytek app (such as the fencing journal app)
alexa - the fytek alexa fencing match skill saves an anonymous unique identifier for the user who made the request (generated by amazon's alexa infrastructure)
we only access your zip code to locate tournaments in your area when you allow access and do not otherwise specify a city or state to search
we do not otherwise collect any personal data or sell your information to any third parties
the use of any personal information is strictly limited to providing a better user experience in the application
