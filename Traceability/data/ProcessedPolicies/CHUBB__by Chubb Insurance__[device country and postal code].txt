how we use “cookies” and other data collection tools
chubb may place electronic “cookies” in the browser files of your computer or mobile device when you access a chubb website
cookies are pieces of information that a chubb website transfers to your computer or mobile device to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to tailor the information on our websites to your interests
for example, if you previously visited a chubb website and accessed your account information or inquired about particular services over the website, cookies enable us to present information tailored to your account and/or those particular interests the next time you visit the website
moreover, chubb or our third party service providers or business partners may place cookies on your computer or mobile device that can be matched to other personal information we maintain about you to pre-populate certain online forms for your convenience
we also use cookies to analyze visitors’ use of our websites
this analysis helps us better understand which areas of our sites are most useful and popular so we can plan improvements and updates accordingly
third parties, including facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from chubb websites and apps and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target advertisements to you
why are cookies important for the use of chubb websites
we use cookies to improve the functionality of this website and to track information about how the website is used in order to continually improve it and personalize it to user preferences
cookies enable an individually tailored use of the websites
some functions on our websites cannot be used without cookies, i
logging in or changing settings
cookies need to be enabled for optimal use of the website
we are unable to monitor visitor numbers for our website without cookies
security and fraud risks on our site increase without this information, which is something we wish to avoid
cookies allow us to check how users access and navigate our site
this is very important in order to make the website better and more user friendly
cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies
this website uses both persistent and session cookies
a persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which allows us to collect and analyze (on an anonymous basis) traffic and use of this website, monitor the system and improve operating performance, for example, store your preferences to enhance your subsequent visits
it will not be automatically deleted when the browser is closed but is stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user before the expiration date)
a session cookie is essential to ensure the correct functioning of this website and is used to manage registration/login and access to reserved features
it is stored temporarily during a browsing session and will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed
it is also important to be aware that some cookies (which are generally session cookies) are what is known as strictly necessary
strictly necessary cookies enable you to move around the website and use features which you have explicitly requested
you can disable other forms of cookie while allowing strictly necessary cookies - see “your cookies choices” below
clear gifs, pixel tags, and other technologies
in addition to cookies, we may also use other means of passively collecting non-personally identifiable data about your use of our web sites, such as through the use of “clear gifs” (small pieces of data that may be embedded in images on our web sites that enable us to track your usage of our web sites) and analyzing “click stream” data (the virtual trail you leave behind while browsing the internet and viewing our web sites)
we use clear gifs and click stream data to gather data about your visit to our web sites and in connection with emails to track response rates
the data may include information about your device, such as your ip address, but does not identify you by name
blocking cookies will prevent clear gifs from tracking your activity, and also prevent us from collecting certain other information, such as your ip address
but we still obtain a record of a visit
in addition to the information we collect from cookies, from clear gifs, through the analysis of click stream data, and any other means we may employ to collect non-personally identifiable information about you or your visits to our web sites, we may also obtain anonymous information which you provide to us online -- for example, when you use our tools and calculators
you can enable or disable cookies by adjusting your browser settings
this allows you to reject the placement of all cookies (except strictly necessary cookies)
you can also delete cookies which have already been placed on your device
please remember that disabling or deleting some or all cookies may prevent some web services (including on this website) from functioning correctly, and may lead to a less smooth or less personalized browsing experience
you should visit the “help” section of your browser for how to manage your cookie settings, or follow the links below
for further general information on cookies and more detailed advice on how to disable and enable them please go to http
we and our service providers or third-party ad servers may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the online services
while, as described above, you may have the opportunity to control the use of cookies through your web browser, we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate
for more information about do not track, please visit www
we use automated devices and applications, such as google analytics, to evaluate usage of our online services
we also may use other analytic means to evaluate our online services
we use these tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences
these entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services
we do not share your name and contact information with these third party analytics providers
however, these providers may obtain unique identifiers for your device or your ip address
third party advertising networks
we use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e
, social networking platforms)
this enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested
third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, javascript, web beacons (including clear gifs), flash cookies and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you
these third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one
we may provide these third-party advertisers with information about you
opting-out of third party ad networks
you may opt out of many third-party ad networks
for example, you may go to the digital advertising alliance (“daa”) consumer choice page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by daa companies
you may also go to the network advertising initiative (“nai”) consumer opt-out page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by nai members
opting out from one or more companies listed on the daa consumer choice page or the nai consumer opt-out page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising on other websites
you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i
, contextually based ads)
also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the daa or nai websites, your opt out may not be effective

where your personal information is processed by esis or another chubb entity acting as a service provider to a chubb client, you should refer to the privacy policy of the relevant chubb client, and submit any request to exercise ccpa rights directly to that client
