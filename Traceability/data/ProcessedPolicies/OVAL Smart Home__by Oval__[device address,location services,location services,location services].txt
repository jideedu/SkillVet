online activity and tracking oval digital employs and makes use of technologies such as cookies and web beacons (also known as clear gifs) to automatically receive and store certain information about your use of the oval services
cookies refer to small bits of data that are based on your internet activity and stored as text files by your internet browser on your computer’s hard drive
through the use of cookies, we may collect information about your location and your online activity on the site, such as the specific web pages that you visit, the links that you click, and the services you use on the site
when you visit other websites where we advertise, we, or a third-party, may use data collected on the site to show you interest-based advertisements, also called remarketing codes
this type of advertising seems to follow you over the web, however, you can also deactivate remarketing codes just like you can deactivate cookies
although most internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you can generally find a “help” section on your browser’s toolbar that will inform you how to stop accepting cookies, to be notified when you receive a browser cookie, and to disable existing browser cookies
however, please keep in mind that if you disable browser cookies, you may be unable to take advantage of all the features that the site has to offer
use of web beacons
web beacons are tiny graphics that are embedded on a website and allow the website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request
we may use web beacons to collect information about your web browsing activities to help us determine if a particular webpage on the site has been visited, and, if so, how many times
this information permits us, or third-parties, to deliver interest-based advertisements, measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, customize the services offered to the site’s users, and for other legitimate business purposes
the web beacons are provided by our ad management partners, which may include google analytics, omniture, and other companies
these files enable google analytics and omniture (including remarketing codes) to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our web site
the cookie on your web browser was placed by oval digital, or by another advertiser who works with google analytics
with both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share, is anonymous and not personally identifiable
it does not contain your name, address, telephone number, email address or any sensitive personal data
our website also includes social media features (e
social media message boards, blogs, and forums
the facebook “like” button and widgets
or interactive mini-programs that run on our site)

org/choices and follow the instructions found therein

our ads do not collect any sensitive personal data about you
please note that there are many advertising networks currently in existence on the internet and opting out from only one (1) or two (2) of those networks, such as those examples listed above, does not guarantee that you will not be effectively tracked by other advertisers

lastly, if you use our services through a mobile device, you may also use your device’s settings for control items such as your location sharing, tailored advertising and other privacy settings

information security we have implemented various security measures for the purpose of protecting your pii and sensitive personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access and against any other unlawful forms of processing
when you make a purchase over a secure portion of our site, your pii and sensitive personal data benefits from the protections of secure sockets layer (“ssl”) technology
our web servers have been enabled with ssl technology to automatically encrypt your information and help prevent unauthorized parties from viewing your payment information during a secure session
this is why you must enter your payment information each time you place a purchase order through the site
from time to time, we may use third-party payment partners in order to bill and process any payments and/or subscriptions made via the site or the app
these platforms will request that you disclose to them sensitive information in order to complete purchases and operations related to the oval services
such third-party payment processing platforms are governed by their own safety standards, policies and terms of use
you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password that you use with the app
you are responsible for all uses of your password, whether authorized by you or not
it is your duty to inform us immediately of any unauthorized use or your username or password
if you do notify us of any unauthorized use of your username or password, we reserve the right to immediately suspend your account to provide you with the opportunity to reset or change any information that was, or may have been, compromised
however, the transmission of data over the internet by its nature entails the use of systems under the control of third parties
while oval digital will work diligently to prevent any violation of our security systems, we cannot ensure the security of third party systems that are outside of our control
third-party websites please be aware that our site and app may contain links to other sites on the internet that are wholly owned and operated by third parties
our site utilizes framing techniques and technologies to make it appear that the user is still on the site when, in fact, the user is actually on a third-party website
for example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of the site, but the url listed in your browser is not www
com , then you should know and be aware that any information is being collected by a third-party and, as such, their privacy policy and terms of use shall govern the collection and use of such information at that time
the information practices of any websites linked to our site are not covered by the terms of this policy
as such, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of any websites to which the site links you to
if you do provide any information to such third-parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your pii and sensitive personal data may apply
we strongly recommend and encourage you to review any such third-party’s privacy policies before providing any data to them
these third-party sites may send their own cookies or web beacons to users, collect data or solicit pii and, as such, we cannot, and do not, control this collection of information
you should contact these entities directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect
please also take into account that we shall not be responsible for the business practices employed by any such third-party websites, including the information or content contained therein
please remember that when you use a link to go to another website, our policy and terms do not apply to those third-party websites or services
your browsing and interactions thereof are at your own and final risk

personal data subject rights the general data protection regulation (the “gdpr”) allows individuals in the european union (the “eu”) greater control over their personal data and grants them a number of rights with regard to how that data is processed, stored, and accessed
for the purposes of the gdpr, oval digital is a “data controller” of pii that you provide to us for the primary purposes of providing you with the oval services
while the gdpr is primarily intended for users in the eu, we believe that the gdpr currently offers the most advanced level of protection for you as a user
