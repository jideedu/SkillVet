except to allow you to use the features and functionalities of the product, website, services and — if you opt to receive them— certain partners’ and/or affiliates’ products and services, we only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you or whoever uses the tracker personally

as part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our website or services
we share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience
