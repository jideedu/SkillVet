zurich insurance plc – data retention policy
there are a number of factors influencing how long we will hold personal data, including but not limited to the following
the regulatory rules set out in applicable laws and regulations or set out in codes issued by regulatory authorities
the type of product that we have provided to you
the type of data that we hold about you
whether the data relates to any ongoing, pending, threatened, imminent or likely litigation or investigation
as a general rule, we hold your information for the periods set out below
15 months for personal insurances and 3 years for commercial insurances
policy and claims information
20/40 years after your policy has ceased or 20/40 years from the date of settlement of a claim under that policy, whichever is the later date *
*for non-motor policies that provide liability insurance cover (for example, household policies) we retain data for 40 years to enable us to deal with latent claims (situations where a claimant does not become aware of the damage or injury until a long time after it was caused)
for all other policies we retain data for 20 years to enable us to deal with claims reported within the statute of limitations
after the above periods have been reached, we will anonymise your personal data
"anonymisation" of data means processing it with the aim of irreversibly preventing the identification of the individual to whom it relates
data can be considered anonymised when it does not allow identification of the individuals to whom it relates, and it is not possible that any individual could be identified from the data by any further processing of that data or by processing it together with other information which is available or likely to be available
