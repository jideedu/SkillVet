your privacy is very important to us at mandato
we will never sell or give away any of the information you provide
to have a personalized experience, we ask you for your school district, and this is saved between sessions in our database
we associate this with the alexa userid that is provided to the skill, which is unique between each alexa/amazon account
we request permission to your country code/region in order to get your local time zone, to compare dates accurately
this information is not stored or persisted after your alexa session ends (when you say exit or goodbye)
the skill also looks for your locale (ex
en-us) which may be used to provide localization/translations in the future
for now we only provide responses in english
no other information about you is gathered at this time
