legal basis for processing personal information (eea visitors only)
if you are a visitor from the european economic area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it
however, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent to do so
in some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you
if we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information)
similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are
if you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the " how to contact us " heading below
your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident
these countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective)
specifically, the dynatrace group of companies (dynatrace llc and its subsidiaries) operates around the world, as listed here
we also use cloud applications hosted by third-party service providers, whose servers are often located in the united states and other locations as listed here
this means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries
however, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy notice
these include implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal information between our group of companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the eea in accordance with european union data protection and privacy law
our standard contractual clauses can be provided on request
we have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request
we retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements)
when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible
your data protection rights
you may exercise the rights available to you under applicable data protection laws
if you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described under " how to contact us " below
if you are a resident of the european union, you may
access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information
object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information
in the limited circumstances where we have collected and process your personal information for a specific purpose with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time
withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted based on your consent prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent
once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal information for the purpose originally agreed to, unless we have another legal basis for processing
you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information
