legal basis to process your personal data
under the applicable data protection laws we need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data
the law allows for six lawful bases to process people’s personal data, and one of them allows personal data to be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organisation – as long as it is fair and balanced and does not unduly impact the rights of individuals
due to the nature of our business and the size of our databases, it is not practical for us to ask every individual for his/her consent
we have assessed our and our clients’ business interests in carrying out marketing activities and we have carefully considered the impact the collection and use of personal data could potentially have on individuals’
our databases contain business data, which is used to promote business in the uk and such activities are unlikely to affect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals concerned
we have therefore concluded that the most appropriate lawful ground for the processing of your personal is our and our client’s legitimate interests
in the event you request any goods and/or services from us, we will rely on our contractual relationship to process your personal data to provide such goods and/or services to you
in certain very limited circumstances we may also rely on a specific consent provided by you for the processing of your personal data
in those circumstances you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us – see our contact details below
