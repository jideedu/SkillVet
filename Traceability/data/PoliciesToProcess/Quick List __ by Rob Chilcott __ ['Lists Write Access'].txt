the quick list skill (available in us and uk amazon alexa skill stores) allows you to add multiple items to your alexa shopping list with a single command
it does this by linking to your alexa shopping list
for quick list to work, you need to give the skill permission to add items to your list ("write permission")
this only allows quick list to add items to your shopping list
it cannot read items already on your list, nor does it log or store the names of items you add using quick list
the quick list skill does not collect any personal data, nor personally identifiable data, even if you add personal information to your shopping list via the skill
account linking is required, and nothing from the skill is stored in a database or retrieval system outside of amazon's own servers
if the nature or funtionality of the quick list skill changes such that this privacy statement requires an update, users will be notified via the skill description in the alexa app,
and also via the welcome message in the skill itself
thank you for your interest in quick list, and in the alexa skills of alexaworks
