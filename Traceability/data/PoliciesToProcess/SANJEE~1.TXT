copyright pertaining to recipes
copyright is a form of intellectual property
in india, copyrights are dealt with by the copyright act 1957
this act covers work’s in which copyright subsists – e
original literary, musical, dramatic works and others
recipes fall under “literary” work
it is generally understood that an idea cannot have copyright
but the way an idea is expressed has copyright
which means if a recipe consists of a list of ingredients followed by the method of cooking, it has no copyright - as for instance in a recipe of how to boil potatoes
however, if a particular recipe is published in a cookbook, and is a part of sequence of menus and other recipes, then copyright exists in that cookbook
in other words it is not just a set of recipes that is protected
rather the originality of style and expression contained in the recipe is also protected
suppose you try out a certain recipe from a particular cookbook and you liked the way it turned out yet you want to adapt it to suit the needs and tastes of your individualistic family – like if you feel the need to reduce the amount of oil or chilli powder then such adaptations are your own and you are not violating copyright of the original book even when you share it with other readers on www
then again if you tried out a recipe from a particular cookbook and relished it exactly the way it is given in it, you can still share it with others if you express the method of preparation in your own words and you would not be violating the copyright
you can also state which book inspired your – the author is sure to appreciate the credit given and also feedback that may follow
cookery is an art as well as science, a skill that can be inherited or learnt and which is constantly evolving and adapting to the various needs
and sharing it with others can be very fulfilling
and we at www
com want to do just that – share this art and science with you so that you too can experience this unique fulfilment and convey it to others on www
