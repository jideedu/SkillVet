this skill collects no personal information about its user
it requests access to your alexa lists as a way to store a list of the friends and family whose status you'd like to check on
while the skill will read the names and phone numbers of the people you enter into the "safe and well" list, it does so only to submit that information to the red cross safe and well system
it does not retain, store, or transmit that information to any other party
you may add or remove people from your safe and well contact list at any time
