registration data (such as your first name, last name, and password)
credit card or debit card numbers and expiration dates if used so that you can register for events or other activities through this site
other information we collect through this site may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your ip address and information collected by cookies

to the extent there is a conflict between this policy and our notice of privacy practices , the stricter of the two applies
this policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices ("privacy notices"), provided at the time we collect your information
for example, certain pages of this site may contain privacy notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information
in other cases, specific privacy notices may be required to comply with applicable law
by using this site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this policy (and any privacy notices that apply to you)

information you manually provide
allina health collects the information you manually provide (using your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad) when you use this site
for example, we collect the information you provide when you create an account, make a purchase, communicate with us, schedule an appointment, sign up for an event, or otherwise interact with this site
some of the information you manually provide may be personal information, such as your name and contact information
information from your browser or device

other information associated with the interaction of your browser and this site (collectively referred to as "traffic data")
the information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings
traffic data is stored in temporary log files that reside on our web servers
traffic data is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable
generally, we use traffic data in the aggregate to help us improve this site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors
however, we may combine traffic data with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you
we may also review our log files for security purposes—for example, to detect intrusions into our network—and we might share our log files with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you
information collected by cookies and other technologies
we use "cookies" and other technologies to collect information and support certain features of this site
for example, we may use these technologies to
collect information about the ways visitors use this site—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page
support the features and functionality of this site—for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits
personalize your experience when you use this site
improve our marketing efforts, including through use of targeted advertising
the information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may link it to personal information that you provide
if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer
although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of this site if your browser rejects our cookies
information about third-party cookies
in addition to the cookies allina health delivers to your computer or mobile device through this site, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons
for example, we use google analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our sites
see information from google analytics about safeguarding your data
other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time and across non-affiliated websites and/or delivering targeted advertisements either on this site or on other websites
you have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our sites
for example, if you don’t want information about your visit to this site sent to google analytics, you may download an opt-out browser add-on at tools
please note that the add-on does not prevent information from being sent to allina health
to opt out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to this site or other websites, go to aboutads
this industry-developed website contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes

we may provide basic demographic information (gender and age) in conjunction with providing individualized data
third parties may use this information for analytical purposes and to market their own products and services, and for such other purposes as we may authorize
we will take reasonable efforts to ensure that third parties cannot and do not re-identify individualized data, including by contractually prohibiting them from doing so
