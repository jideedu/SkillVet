stallion services and tools for building alexa skills
thanks for using stallion wp to alexa plugin or visiting our website
this policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you visit our website, or when you use our service
it also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information
your privacy really matters
at stallion, we have a few fundamental principles
we don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it
we don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights
we don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services
we don’t sell any of your personal information
stallion (“stallion” or the “service”) is both a wordpress plugin and a website aimed at helping developers build and deploy amazon alexa skills for their clients
stallion is owned and operated by stallion ventures, inc
(“sv,” “we,” or “us”)
stallion has employees, independent contractors, and representatives (“our team”)
as a customer of the service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the service, you’re a “member” according to this agreement (or “you”)
if you have any questions or comments, or if you want to update, delete, or change any personal information we hold, or you have a concern about the way in which we have handled any privacy matter, you are more than welcome to contact us at contact@getstallion
we only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you, or to make our services better
we collect information in two ways
if and when you provide information to us (such as purchasing a stallion license or registering an account on our support forum) and automatically through operating our services (such as activating a stallion license on your website)
let’s go over the information that we collect
information you provide to us
we collect information that you provide to us
the amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information
here are some examples
we ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account
for example, we require individuals who sign up for an stallion forum account to provide a username and email address–and that’s it
you may provide us with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that information to create your account
if you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile
for example, if you have an stallion forum account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile
your public profile is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include
if you post on our community forum, we collect the information you submit (as a topic, reply or upload)
transaction and billing information
if you buy something from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information
you may also provide us information when you contact us, communicate with our support team, or post a comment on our blog
information we collect automatically
we also collect some information automatically
we collect information about your usage of our services
for example, we collect information to authenticate a license activation and provide plugin updates
we use this information to provide our services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our services, so we can make our services better
when you enter and activate a license within your wordpress website, we collect information to authenticate and provide software updates for that website
this information includes the license key, stallion version, wordpress version, website name, website url, website language and timezone
like most website operators, we collect information that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request
we and our partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole
users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level
how we use information
we use information about you as mentioned above and as follows
to provide our services to you
for example, to set up and maintain your account, provide plugin updates, or charge you for any of our paid services
to further develop our services
for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently
to monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our services, which helps us improve our services and make them easier to use
to monitor and protect the security of our services , detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of stallion and others
to send you informational and promotional content in accordance with your marketing preferences
you can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email

we share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy
subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors

we may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us

we require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them
as required by law
we may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request
to protect rights and property
we may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of stallion, third parties, or the public at large
for example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay
in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that stallion goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party
if any of these events were to happen, this privacy policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this privacy policy
we may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction
for example, we may share your information with third parties who are able to help solve a support ticket, such as your website’s host
and if you send us a request (for example, via a support email), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users
information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly
that means, of course, that information like your public profile and comments are all available to others
public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties
please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share
notice of breach of security
if a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that affects you in any way, then stallion will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response
we take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information
