website terms & conditions
pseg provides this privacy policy because we know that you care about how your information is collected, used, shared, and retained
this privacy policy applies to information collected through the site or through mobile applications released by pseg
by visiting the site, registering on the site, or using the services provided through the site by pseg or through mobile applications released by pseg from time to time, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information as set forth in this privacy policy
as a visitor you need not register or give any personal identification to use the site
unless otherwise stated, all defined terms shall have the meaning set forth in our terms of use
pse&g skill on amazon’s alexa service terms & conditions
this agreement is between you and public service electric and gas company, a new jersey corporation having offices at 80 park plaza, newark, new jersey 07102 (together, with its parent and affiliates, "pse&g" or “us” or “we”) and governs your use of the pse&g skill on amazon’s alexa service on any alexa-enabled device (the “skill”)
the agreement applies in addition to, and is not intended to replace, any other agreement that may apply in connection with your accounts for services you receive from pse&g ("account(s)")
before using the skill, please read these terms and conditions, the pse&g website terms & conditions , the pse&g privacy policy and the pse&g disclaimer (collectively, the “agreement”)
your use of the skill is conditioned on your acceptance of this agreement
if you don’t accept these terms, you may not use the skill
the skill allows you to use your alexa-enabled device to communicate with pse&g, by voice, regarding your account(s)
your voice is only used to activate alexa’s features and is not used to authenticate the account
to use the skill, you will have to speak commands and questions aloud to amazon’s alexa service (“alexa”), and you will receive responses aloud
any communication to pse&g via alexa will be treated by pse&g as a communication authorized by you, and any communication from pse&g via alexa in response to a request received from your alexa-enabled device will be treated by pse&g as a communication to you
in other words, you are responsible for all of the interactions with pse&g via the skill
for example, it is possible that someone other than you could interact with pse&g via the skill, or that someone could overhear you interacting with pse&g via the skill and learn information about your account(s)
(try using your “inside voice
”) it is also possible that alexa (and the equipment alexa is installed on) and/or amazon will record your interactions with the skill or with alexa
consult your agreements with amazon to learn more about how amazon and your alexa-enabled device treat those interactions
release of your information to amazon
by installing the skill, you are authorizing pseg to perform the actions and/or share with amazon the information you communicate to pseg (such as voice commands), or which pseg may request from you
the interactions you have with the skill take place through amazon
for example, if you ask alexa for any information pertaining to your account, pseg transmits the relevant information through amazon
therefore, you hereby authorize pseg to share that information with amazon in response to your interactions with the skill
one of the things you may be able to do on the skill is pay your pse&g account balance
you will be given choices about how much to pay (e
, total amount due or partial payment) and what bank account to use to make your payment
by using the skill on your alexa-enabled device, you authorize pse&g to initiate payments in amounts up to your account balance
the payment(s) will be initiated on the date(s) you direct alexa to do so (“payment date”), but when you pay using ach debit, the timing of the withdrawal from your pay-from account (i
, the checking or savings account that you use to pay down the bill) will be based on the pay-from account’s processing schedule
in other words, if you pay your pse&g bill from your bank x checking account, we’ll start the process when you ask us to (and it usually takes less than two days), but we can’t promise how long it will take overall because it depends on the timing of bank x debiting your account and sending it to us
once you set up your alexa device with the skill, you are authorizing pse&g to provide information to the device based on the device’s security settings
for example, the settings on your device may allow the device to retrieve information about your account(s) based on only verbal requests from anyone who uses your device, or to save information about your account(s) for easier access
by enabling the skill on your alexa-enabled device, you are responsible for how the skill is used (including any communication to or from pse&g from your device)
we didn’t design or manufacture alexa or your alexa-enabled device
the device also runs other software (e
, alexa and other third-party apps) that we did not write or design and do not have control over
it’s possible that alexa will not hear you correctly, will incorrectly translate what you said, or even say something to you different than the information we provided to alexa
by accepting this agreement, you understand and agree that pse&g is not responsible for inaccuracies in your interactions with pse&g via the skill
if you have any issues or doubts about the accuracy of your interactions with pse&g via the skill, you can still get your account details by logging on to your account(s) on our website at www
as with any application, it’s possible that there will be bugs
in addition to the possibility of alexa mishearing you or misquoting us, there’s also a possibility that something might not work correctly, or might not work at all
by using the skill, you’re accepting that risk
again, you do not need the skill to access your account(s)
all of the information available from pse&g via the skill is also available on our website (see “accuracy” section, above)
don’t rely on the skill as your sole means of accessing your account(s)
electronic records and signatures
by accepting these terms, you consent to the general use of electronic records and signatures in our relationship with you
hardware and other requirements
to access pse&g via the skill, you must (1) have an active residential account that is in good standing, (2) be enrolled in pse&g’s my account, (3) be 18 years of age or older and a legal resident of the 50 united states or the district of columbia, and (4) have an alexa-enabled device, an internet connection, and an amazon account
you cannot use the skill otherwise
we may seek your constructive feedback on the skill, including problems you encounter, aspects that work well, and suggestions for improving it
you agree that pse&g may email you from time to time about your experience with the skill
we may change, suspend, or discontinue the skill, or any part of it, at any time without notice
we may amend any of this agreement's terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on our website at pse&g skill on amazon’s alexa service terms & conditions
your continued use of the skill after the effective date of the revised agreement constitutes acceptance of the terms
your rights under this agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms
in case of such termination, we may immediately revoke your access to the skill
pse&g may or may not provide technical and other support for the skill
you agree to abide by any support rules and policies
if such support is provided, it will be provided in addition to any normal support for your account(s) and will be available exclusively through the pilot while you are a participant
you assume all risk for your use of the skill, that it is provided “as is”, and that pse&g makes no warranty or representation, either express or implied
pse&g expressly disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement
no advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from pse&g, or through or from the skill, will create any warranty of any kind
this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new jersey without regard to any portion of its choice of law principles that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction's law
provided, however, that to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws, this agreement will not be subject to the uniform computer information transactions act as currently enacted or as may be codified or amended from time to time by any jurisdiction
you irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the united states district courts for the district of new jersey, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, to the courts of the state of new jersey located in essex county
pse&g trademarks and graphics used in connection with the skill are the property of pse&g
all other trademarks and graphics used are the property of their respective owners
