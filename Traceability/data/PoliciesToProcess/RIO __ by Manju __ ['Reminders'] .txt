how did aging turn from a celebration of a natural process to a problem that needs to be solved
the only physiologically relevant change as we get older is that when aging cells die, they cause inflammation and pain within the body
so here’s our proposal
let’s work together to reduce the pain and improve the mobility so we can have more fun doing the things that make us happy
because ultimately, all that matters if how old we feel
