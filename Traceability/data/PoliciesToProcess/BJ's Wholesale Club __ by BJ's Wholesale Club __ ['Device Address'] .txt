some third parties such as bj’s travel and bj’s auto buying, though bj’s-branded, are not operated by bj’s
any information that you provide directly to third parties or member service partners is subject to their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to read those privacy policies when you do so
should you wish to change your marketing preferences with respect to any third party or member service partner, please be sure to do so by following the instructions contained in the individual privacy policies
to the extent that information collected through your use of bj’s sites, bj’s wifi or clubs is patient information provided to obtain optical services, such information is governed by the bj’s optical notice of privacy practices and not this privacy policy
we reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time
we encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy and will post the date the policy was last revised to help you determine whether any changes have been made
your continued use of bj’s sites or bj’s wifi, patronage of our clubs, or interaction with bj’s constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any updates
we know that you care about how your information is used and shared, and your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us
we want to help you understand the information we collect about you, how it is used, how it is shared, and the safeguards that we have in place to protect it
this privacy policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your information
what information do we collect
as described below, we collect information about you when you provide that information to us or when we collect it automatically through your interactions with us
we might also receive some information about you from other sources
we generally refer to this information in the policy as personal information
we, or those acting on our behalf, may collect the personal information that you provide to us, such as when you purchase, renew, or modify your bj’s membership, visit or make a purchase in our clubs or on bj’s sites, create an account on bj’s sites, contact our member care agents, apply for a job with bj’s, access and use bj’s wifi, sign up for bj’s newsletters, participate in surveys, respond to marketing emails, promotions, sweepstakes, or contests that bj’s offers or administers, or otherwise communicate or interact with us in any fashion
the information that you provide us can include, but is not limited to

employment information, such as information you provide us when submitting an employment application form
other information that we collect or you provide, such as when contacting us or through the course of visiting or using bj’s sites, bj’s wifi, or our clubs, or otherwise interacting with us, including engaging with bj’s social media channels
we might not be able to provide you with certain services if you choose not to provide us with the personal information requested
information automatically collected from you
we, and our service providers, may automatically collect information from you or your devices while you visit or use bj’s sites, bj’s wifi, or our clubs
for example, we might collect certain transaction-related information, your internet protocol (“ip”) address, device information (for example, device identifiers, operating system and version, application version, language region, and time zone, among others),
advertising identifiers, your general location, your browser type, the website that referred you to us, if any, the items you view or place in your shopping cart on bj’s sites, and movement taken through bj’s sites
we use a variety of technical methods to automatically collect information, including cookies,
web beacons online, and in-store beacons in our clubs
see the section titled “information collected through cookies and web beacons” below for more information about our online collection of information
when you access bj’s wifi, we may also automatically collect information from your mobile device, such as the device’s media access control (“mac”) address, its association to specific wireless access points (which can be used to approximate your location within a bj’s club), date, time and duration of use, device type and operating system, and the amount of bandwidth used
when using bj’s wifi or when we have sensors in our stores to detect your device, we may use in-club technology to measure foot traffic and flow patterns
our clubs are equipped with cctv cameras that monitor the club and its surroundings for security and loss prevention purposes and to enhance your shopping experiences
collection of your precise location information
when you use a bj’s mobile application, including when you have our mobile application open, or connect to our wi-fi, we and our service providers may collect your precise location information
we’ll generally collect your precise location information with your permission, such as when you continue using a service after we notify you of the collection of your location information, or when you grant us access to your device’s gps (like we request in the bj’s mobile application)
you can stop us from collecting your device’s gps by changing your location services preferences

if you choose to link your social-media account or accounts relating to other third-party services to your membership or bj’s sites, wifi, or other services, you may be allowing those third parties to send us some of your information, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this privacy policy
