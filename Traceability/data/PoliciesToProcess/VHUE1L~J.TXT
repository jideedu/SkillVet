how do we use your data
data protection law says that we can use personal data only if we have a proper reason to do so
this includes sharing it outside virgin trains
the law says we must have one or more of these reasons
to fulfil a contract we have with you
when it's our legal duty
when it's in our legitimate interest
when you consent to it
a legitimate interest is when we have a legitimate business or commercial reason to use your information
but even then, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you
if we rely on our legitimate interest, we will tell you what that is
below is a list of all the ways that we may use your personal data, and which of the reasons we rely on to do so
our legitimate interests are also below

what happens if we send your data outside of the eea
we will only send your data outside of the european economic area (‘eea’) to
comply with a legal duty
provide our products and services
if we do transfer information outside of the eea, we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it was being used in the eea
to do this, we will use one or more of these safeguards
only transfer it to a non-eea country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the eea, as deemed by the european commission
ensure that a contract with the recipient is in place that means they must protect it to the same standards as the eea
transfer it to organisations that are part of privacy shield
this is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the us and eu countries
you can find out more about these safeguards on the european commission justice and information commissioner’s office (ico) websites
here is a list of the services we currently use which are located outside of the eea
what happens if you choose not to give us your personal data
we may need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you
if you choose not to give us this personal data, it may delay or prevent us providing our products or services to you
for example, not providing an email address would prevent us from providing you with an e-ticket to travel
sometimes we might ask for information that is useful for us to know but is not required by law or a contract
when this is the case, we will make this clear by marking it as optional
you do not have to provide these extra bits of information, and your choice will not prevent us providing you with our products or services
how do we use your data for marketing
we may use your personal data to tell you about our relevant products, competitions and offers
this is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’
we may also use your data to help create a profile to find potential customers like you
we will send you marketing based on what you tell us about yourself, data we collect when you use our services, and using information from third parties we work with
we use this information to get a view on what we think would interest you the most
we will only send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a legitimate interest
this is when we have a legitimate business or commercial reason to use your information that does not unfairly go against what is right and best for you
you can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time by clicking unsubscribe at the bottom of any marketing email or updating your preferences in your online account
whatever you choose for marketing, you'll still receive service messages, such as booking confirmations and timetable changes
how will we treat children’s privacy
while it is possible for someone of any age to register and purchase some of our products or services, our products and services do not specifically address anyone under the age of 13
from time to time we may run competitions that children are invited to join, when this happens we would require the parent to submit the work on their behalf, and information is only kept for the duration of that competition
where we can, we do request date of birth to help identify those persons
in the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with consent for marketing, we will immediately remove this consent
if you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us using one of the methods in the 'how to contact us' section so that we will be able to take the necessary actions

we will keep your personal data for as long as you are a customer of virgin trains

this is known as the ‘right to object’ and ‘right to erasure’, or the ‘right to be forgotten’
please note such requests may not always be possible due to legal obligations we may have to keep such records
for example, ensuring you still have your rights under the consumer rights act
in some cases, there will be legitimate, legal, or other official reasons for us to keep your data
but please tell us if you think that we should not be using it
it may be possible for us to restrict the use of your data
this means that it would only be used for certain activities, such as legal claims or to exercise legal rights

you can ask us to restrict the use of your personal data if
it is not accurate
it has been used unlawfully but you don’t want us to delete it
it’s not relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in legal claims
you have already asked us to stop using your data but you are waiting for us to tell you if we can keep on using it
if you want to object to how we use your data, ask us to delete it or restrict how we use it, please contact us using one of the methods in the 'how to contact us' section
do you want to withdraw your consent or object to when we use our legitimate interest for marketing
