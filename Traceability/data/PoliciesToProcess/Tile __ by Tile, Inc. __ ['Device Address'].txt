generally, in this privacy policy, the term "personal information" means any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person

indirectly, in particular by reference to a name, an identification number, or, in certain
circumstances, location information, an ip address or the unique identifier allocated to each tile

information from your use of the services
tile id, name, and photograph
when you activate a tile using the tile app, that tile’s unique identifier (or tile id) will be
associated with your account
if you choose to name your tile or add a photo of it, this information
will also be associated with your account
tile is designed to tell you where your items are
in order to do that, it’s necessary to collect data
we use the term “location information” to refer to the combined location data of
your phone or device, and your tiles
while the app is running on your device, it periodically transmits your location information

tile normally only records the latest location information update for each of your tiles, to provide the
for tile premium users, location information for each tile is stored for up to
30 days, to support the location history feature
in both cases, tile does this so you can find
the most recent location information for your tiles, in case you lose them
location information is archived in a way that cannot be associated with you using a process called
pseudonymization, where data will be untraceable to a specific tile user
archival data so we can answer general questions unrelated to any person, such as “how many tiles were
in london in 2016 versus 2017
we may also collect and update location information for your tile(s) anonymously from other tile users
who are running the tile app or from other third parties that are using an app or device that has
integrated the tile functionality (each, a “tile finder”) within bluetooth range of your device

your devices’ bluetooth range

finders to help each other find their lost tiles

anonymously and does not identify the owner of a tile to others

of that computer or device to determine an approximate location
we do this so that we can provide you
with a better, more personal customer service experience
