(or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the service, compiling statistic reports on the service’s activity, and providing other services relating to service activity and other internet usage
except to the extent spe combines information from service providers, third-party services, or other third parties with spe-collected pi, in which case spe will treat the combined information as spe-collected pi under this privacy policy (see section 1(c) ), data obtained by spe from a third party, even in association with the service, is not subject to spe’s limitations regarding spe-collected pi under this privacy policy
however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on spe by the third party, if any

any california residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the service, and who have posted content or information on the service, can request removal by contacting spe here , detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it
spe will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law
this removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal
for instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that spe does not control
spe does not "sell" (as that term is defined by the california consumer privacy act (ccpa)) personal information gathered from sites that link to the children's privacy policy
for further information regarding the sale of personal information under the ccpa, please see section 12
accessing and changing information
if you have registered an account with spe, spe provides you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the information you provided to us and associated with your account
spe will make good faith efforts to make such requested changes in spe’s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all your information or public postings from spe’s databases (california minors see section 9 ) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter
further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law
and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law
tracking and communications options
regular cookies and tracking pixels, among other tracking technologies, may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings
browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately
also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), html5 cookies, or other tracking technologies
for information on disabling flash cookies, go to adobe’s website http
you can also manage the use of some tracking technologies such as without limitation cookies and tracking pixels by using spe’s cookie consent tool
please be aware that every website utilizes its own cookies, so cookie preferences should be set for each spe website
if you choose to opt out of any tracking technologies such as without limitation cookies and pixels, a preference cookie will be placed on your device in order to honor that opt-out
if you later clear your browser and delete cookies from your device, by doing so you will also remove the preference cookie
therefore, in order to remain opted out of tracking technologies, you will have to go back to the cookie consent tool and renew your choices
please remember that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the service may not work and that when you revisit the service your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations
