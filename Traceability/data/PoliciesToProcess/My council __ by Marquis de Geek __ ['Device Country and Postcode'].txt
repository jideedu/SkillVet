we also collect information about you and your activities from a third-party when we jointly offer services or products, or from third-party data enrichment providers (to find out more see our privacy key terms ) who may deliver insights to unilever about the personal data we hold
when and why we collect “special categories of personal data”
certain categories of personal data, such as race, ethnicity, religion, health, sexuality or biometric data are classified as “special categories of data” and benefit from additional protection under the european data protection legislation
we limit the circumstances where we collect and process these special categories of data
unilever sometimes collects data related to your health such as allergies, pregnancy or skin type to send you tailored ads and relevant promotions
unilever only collects and uses this personal data where you have provided us with your consent for us to do so
in some instances, you may have requested services or products that do not directly involve the collection of any special categories of data, but may imply or suggest your religion, health or other special categories of data
to illustrate circumstances where unilever collects and processes special categories of data we have provided the following examples
unilever collects expectant mothers’ due dates in its zwitsal or baby dove newsletter sign-up page
it may also place cookies on the sign-up page which capture this information too
this data is then used to create an audience of expectant mothers to receive online advertising from relevant unilever brands
for more information on unilever’s profiling activities, please refer to the relevant section
similarly, unilever collects personal data related to consumers’ allergies to provide consumers with ads and promotions for products which are relevant to their needs
how do we protect children’s privacy
we understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using unilever products and services
most of unilever’s websites are designed and intended for use by adults
where one of our websites is intended for use by a younger audience, we will obtain consent from the person with parental responsibility before we collect personal data where it is required by applicable laws and regulations (the age at which consent is necessary varies from country to country)
if you are a child under the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this privacy notice with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them
if we discover that we have collected personal data from a child without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that personal data as soon as practical
access to certain parts of the unilever’s websites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards are generally limited to users over a certain age
we sometimes use your personal data to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions
what purpose do we use your data for
we collect, process and disclose your personal data only for specific and limited purposes
for example, to process your payments, to assess and handle any complaints, to develop and improve our products, services, communication methods and the functionality of our websites, to provide personalised products, communications and targeted advertising as well as product recommendations to you
we also create profiles by analysing the information about your online surfing, searching and buying behaviour and your interactions with our brand communications by building segments (creating groups that have certain common characteristics) and by placing your personal data in one or more segments
additionally, unilever processes your personal data also using automated means
an automated decision is a decision which is made solely by automatic means, where no humans are involved in the decision-making process related to your personal data
we collect, process and disclose your personal data for the following purposes
to process your payments, if you purchase our products, to provide you with your order status, deal with your enquiries and requests, and assess and handle any complaints
to process and answer your inquiries or to contact you to answer your questions and/or requests
to develop and improve our products, services, communication methods and the functionality of our websites
for the purposes of competitions or promotions that you have entered
to communicate information to you and to manage your registration and/or subscription to our newsletter or other communications
to manage our everyday business needs regarding your participation in our contests, sweepstakes or promotional activities or request
to authenticate the identity of individuals contacting us by telephone, electronic means or otherwise
for internal training and quality assurance purposes
to understand and assess the interests, wants, and changing needs of consumers, to improve our website, our current products and services, and/or developing new products and services
to provide personalised products, communications and targeted advertising as well as product recommendations to you
when we collect and use your personal data for purposes mentioned above or for other purposes, we will inform you before or at the time of collection
where appropriate, we will ask for your consent to process the personal data
where you have given consent for processing activities, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time
in some cases, we rely on legitimate interest for processing your personal data
a legitimate interest could exist for example, when you sign up for a loyalty scheme with one of our brands and we use the personal data collected to conduct data analytics to improve our products or services
this ground will only be used where it is necessary to achieve a legitimate interest, for example to assist in the performance of a contract, or to optimise a service, and does not outweigh your rights as an individual
this legal basis will only be relied upon where there is no less intrusive way to process your personal data
we can assure you that if legitimate interest is used as a ground for processing your personal data, we will keep a record of this and you have the right to ask for this information
we process your personal data to perform a contract to which you are or will be a party
for example, we need to process your personal data to deliver a product or a service you bought, to allow you to take part in one of our competitions, or to send you samples that you have requested
we also process your personal data when we have a legal obligation (e
, tax or social security obligations) to perform such processing
for example, a court order or a subpoena may require us to process personal data for a particular purpose, or we may be compelled to process personal data to report suspicious transactions under the local anti-money laundering rules
unilever uses your personal data to build profiles
we create profiles by analysing the information about your online surfing, searching and buying behaviour and your interactions with our brand communications by building segments (creating groups that have certain common characteristics) and by placing your personal data in one or more segments
these segments are used by unilever to personalise the website and our communications to you (such as showing relevant content to you when you visit our site or in a newsletter to you), and to display relevant offers and advertisements from the unilever brands on the unilever sites, and via third-party websites
the segments can also be used for third-party campaigns on the unilever sites
unilever profiles your data where you have provided consent for us to do so
for example, accepting the setting of cookies on your browser online or signing up for email newsletters from one of our brands
you can withdraw your consent to prevent your personal data being used this way at any time using the manage cookies section of our cookie notice or unsubscribing to the use of your email address if you have logged into one of our websites or signed up to any marketing newsletters
by way of example –
unilever collects data, with your consent, from
our websites about what you view and the way you interact with our content
our digital display advertising that we serve to you on social platforms and other publisher’s websites
forms you fill in online and send to us about what your interests are
we also track the products you buy when you click on one of our display adverts and go on to purchase something from a selection of our retail partners
if you have asked to receive emails or sms communications from us, we track whether you open, read or click on the content to see what you are interested in so that we can give you more content that we think you are more likely to enjoy
we use this data to profile your likes and dislikes
for instance, if we see that you are regularly viewing vegan recipes on our “recipedia” website, and you have opted in to receiving emails from us, we might give you an update on the new vegan recipes that have just hit the site for your interest, or we may tailor our web content when you visit towards things we think you’ll be most interested in
based on this profile information, we may also give you advertising that we think you will like and want to see as you view content from us or from our network of publishers that we advertise with
sometimes, with your consent, we may use your current location to serve advertising to you that is to do with promotions or events that are happening nearby that we think you might be interested in
we may also use information you have provided to selected third-parties and consented to be shared, like your age, gender, life stage, lifestyle and wider interests to identify people who we think will have similar interests to you and who we believe will be interested in similar advertising
in some instances, unilever processes your personal data using automated means
an automated decision is a decision which is made solely by automatic means, where no humans are involved in the decision-making process related to your personal data
unilever uses game simulations of science-based behavioural assessments and data science techniques to assess prospective employees
candidates are required to play a set of games and the behavioural patterns exhibited during gameplay are assessed by a unilever customised algorithm to predict the candidate’s potential for a specific role
this algorithm is regularly tested to ensure it remains fair, effective and unbiased
we will not make decisions based solely on automated decision making that have significant impact on you
if we do so we notify you and provide you with clear information about our decision to rely on automated processing to make our decision and our lawful basis for doing so
for example, unilever processes your personal data using automated means only if it is necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract with you, or when you have given your explicit consent
you have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal or other significant effects on you
in particular, you have the right
to obtain human intervention
to express your point of view
to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after an assessment
to challenge such a decision
