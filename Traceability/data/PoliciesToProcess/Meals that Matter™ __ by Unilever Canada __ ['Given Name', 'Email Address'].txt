what does this privacy policy apply to
this privacy policy applies to personal information collected by the unilever group of companies in connection with the services they offer

or • individuals that unilever does not manage or employ
these third party sites may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions

the majority of unilever sites are designed and intended for use by adults

if you are a child over the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this privacy policy with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them
if we discover that we have collected information without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that information as soon as possible

we may use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions
