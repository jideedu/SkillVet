legal basis for the processing
a gdpr serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific
if the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the
data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods
or to provide any other service, the processing is based on article 6(1) lit
the same applies to such
processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of
inquiries concerning our products or services
is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of
personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on art
in rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject
or of another natural person
this would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his
name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or
then the processing would be based on art
finally, processing operations could be based on article 6(1) lit
this legal basis is used for processing
operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the
purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are
overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of
such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned
by the european legislator
he considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
client of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 gdpr)
the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
where the processing of personal data is based on article 6(1) lit
f gdpr our legitimate interest is to carry out
our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders
period for which the personal data will be stored
the criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period
after expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary
for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract
provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement
requirement necessary to enter into a
obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data
possible consequences of failure to provide
we clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e
tax regulations) or can also result
from contractual provisions (e
information on the contractual partner)
sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which
must subsequently be processed by us
the data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data
when our company signs a contract with him or her
the non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence
that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded
before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our data protection officer
data protection officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law
or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the
personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data
existence of automated decision-making
as a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling
