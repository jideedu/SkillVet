we strive to send these different types of information in accordance with available communication channels, formats, and choices that you have expressed, in each case in compliance with applicable law
while we generally communicate with you in accordance with these preferences, we may sometimes use other channels and formats to best provide you with available services
not all types of information and communication channels, formats, and choices may be available to you or honored at a particular time
for example, the communication preferences available to you through the site may differ from those available to others depending upon your particular prescription drug benefit plan
an expressed communication preference may not be immediately honored for all communications associated with the preference
however, the preference may be honored for future communications when possible
we may also communicate with you through one or more communication channels to enable us to more effectively provide our services to you and, as applicable, on behalf of your plan sponsor
certain communications may include additional ways for you to express preferences
when your preference is expressed in this manner, such preference may be limited to a certain type of information, communication channel, and/or communication format as applicable
for example, if you select an opt-out option available in a particular e-mail, you may only have opted-out of a certain type of e-mail (e
we encourage you to review your communication preferences page(s) from time to time to review your communication options and expressed preferences
reviewing and adjusting communication preferences

these adjustments may, in certain instances, affect which communications you receive and the communication channels by which you receive them
as such, we may notify you of such adjustments and periodically remind you to review your communication preferences
the sending and receipt of communications in certain communication channels may cause you to incur messaging, data usage, or other fees from your services provider
by selecting such communication channels, you agree that you are solely responsible for these fees
by registering for use of the website, we will preselect initial communication preferences
these initial preferences include various communication categories for communicating with you through your provided e-mail address and, as applicable, through our secure message center and/or encrypted messages
in addition, without registering for or logging into the website, when available you can authenticate yourself, provide us with your e-mail address, and agree to this privacy policy and the terms of use for the site to also enable the aforementioned electronic communications
these initial communication preferences will provide you with certain communications through e-mail that were previously provided by automated outbound telephone calls or mail, and some additional communications that you would not have otherwise received
if you have previously expressed preferences to receive communications through a different communication channel, your preferences will be retained
you may modify your communication preferences on the communication preferences page of the website
for example, if you do not wish to receive e-mails or certain types of e-mails from us, you may so designate on the communication preferences page
in general, once you have authorized us to utilize a particular manner of communicating with you, we may cease communicating with you through other communication channels, except as otherwise provided for in this privacy policy or as required by law
we may modify the communication categories associated with your initial communication preferences to better service you
if you modify your initial communication preferences, you may need to login to the website or otherwise authenticate yourself to modify your communication preferences associated with the communication categories
while many registered users have a single plan or program with us, some registered users may have more than one
when you have multiple plans/programs, availability of certain communication types may differ based on the applicable plan/program
we will then send communications with the applicable plan/program under which the communication would fall and your communication preferences in accordance with applicable law

for example, we may send you an e-mail to notify you that a communication including prescription drug information for a prescription drug that has been shipped to you is available in the secure message center
depending upon program/plan preference, you may be able to receive an email containing an encrypted message
if you agree to receive such encrypted communications, you may receive certain encrypted messages electronically instead of through other channels

we seek to provide your communications in an efficient and effective manner
we may selectively utilize known communication channels to communicate with you even when the channels are not designated communication preferences
we may also contact you regarding a particular issue or through a particular communication channel despite an otherwise stated communication preference
in certain instances, we may communicate with you through a different communication channel than an expressed communication preference, or we may utilize multiple communication channels to reach you
examples of when we may not follow your communication preferences include when required by law, when a communication channel is or becomes unavailable, when we are unable to reach you by your preferred communication channel, when you have reached out to us by a particular communication channel and we respond by communicating with you through the same communication channel, when your communication preferences have not been designated, or in the case of an emergency or other extenuating circumstance
you may continue to use all communication channels available to you to reach us regardless of your communication preferences
preference setting for others
depending on the functionality available to you through the site, you may be able to set communications preferences (i) at an individual level so that they are only applicable to you, (ii) at a partner level so that they are applicable both for you and your designated partner, or (iii) at a family level when you are the cardholder (or sponsor) so that the communication preferences are applicable to your covered household members
communications to be received on behalf of others
certain users may designate others to receive all or certain communications on their behalf
in such situations, the user generally may then cease to receive such communications
when available, the designation may be made by selecting a caregiver, granting certain access to a cardholder and/or a covered household member, or otherwise
