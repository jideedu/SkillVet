trust means a lot to us at mitre 10
generations of kiwis have shopped at and trusted mitre 10 and we want that to continue into the future
we’re committed to treating the personal information of our customers with care and respect
this privacy statement relates to mitre 10 (new zealand) limited (“mitre 10 nz”) and to local mitre 10 stores, which are owned and operated by local mitre 10 members (“our stores”) (collectively referred to as “mitre 10”, “we” or “us”)
this privacy statement explains how mitre 10 collects, stores, uses and discloses personal information about its customers
all our stores strive to take a consistent approach to privacy practice but may occasionally handle personal information differently
our stores will tell you before collecting, using or disclosing personal information in ways not covered by this statement
as you’ll see below, we ensure that our practices comply with the privacy act 1993 but we strive to do better than that, and meet industry best practice
mitre 10 is data warranted
mitre 10 nz was one of the first retail organisations in new zealand to be awarded data warranty register (dwr) certification
the dwr was developed and issued by the nz marketing association and provides consumers with confidence that organisations such as mitre 10 nz, will treat personal information with care and respect, in accordance with the law, and industry best practice (which often exceeds legal requirements)
information we collect from you most of the personal information we collect about you is provided to us directly during your interactions with us at our stores or on our website, www
nz, including when you become a member of our loyalty programmes or other loyalty programmes we’re a part of
sometimes, we may ask our partners or service providers to collect personal information from you on our behalf
we always take care to ensure that we only collect personal information needed to provide our services and help run our business
the types of personal information we may collect include
