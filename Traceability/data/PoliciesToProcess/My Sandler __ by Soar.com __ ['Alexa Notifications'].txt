how does sandler keep my personal information secure
we use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you
the measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information
your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident
these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective)
specifically, our website servers are located in usa
this means that when we collect your personal information we process it in usa
however, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy notice
these include implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the eea in accordance with european union data protection law
our standard contractual clauses can be provided on request
we have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request
we retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements)
when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible
our website and any services we provide on this website are not intended for individuals below the age of 18
as such, we do not knowingly process personal information about individuals under the age of 18
if you are a resident of the european economic area, you have the following data protection rights
if you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “how to contact us” heading below
in addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information
again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “how to contact us” heading below
you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time
you can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you

similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time
withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent
you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information
for more information, please contact your local data protection authority
we respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws
