what is amazon alexa and amazon echo & how does it work
alexa-enabled devices such as the amazon echo use voice technology through verbal
activation using a built-in microphone and speaker
activating the speaker requires
saying a designated word (known as the “wake word”) out loud, like “alexa”, or tapping
a button on the speaker or remote control
once an amazon echo is powered-on and ready, it remains in “standby” mode, and no
this is similar to a tv that’s been turned off with a remote control, going
pressing the volume button on the remote won’t turn on the tv
only pressing the power button will turn the tv “on”
alexa “wakes up” or turns on from standby, when it hears a wake word (“alexa” or one
of 3 other options), when the action button with the “dot” is pressed on top of the
devices, or when the remote control's microphone button is pressed and held down
once it turns on, a blue ring lights up, visibly indicating that it is waiting for a request,
