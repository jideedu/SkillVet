what is your privacy policy
what is your privacy statement
("reebok" or "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information
this privacy statement (the "statement") applies to all of the channels in the united states by which reebok collects, uses and/or shares your information, including online channels (e
websites, mobile applications, and social media pages, collectively referred to as the "website") and offline channels (e
, in-store transactions and events in the u
this statement describes the information we collect in the united states and how we use and disclose it
your continued use of the website constitutes your consent to the terms of this statement and any updates
this statement is incorporated into, and is subject to, the terms and conditions
if you do not agree to the terms and conditions or this statement, please do not use the website
we have added a new section below for california residents
what information do we collect and store
except as disclosed below, we don’t sell, trade, give away, or rent your personal information to any third party outside of reebok
one of the basic principles we've tried to follow is to limit the information we collect from and share about you
this section describes how we may collect information through both online and offline channels
we collect and store personal information that you provide to us, including through the website, at our stores and events, and in communications with our customer service department
we combine the information we receive from or about you through any of these channels and use and disclose it in accordance with this statement
in general, you can use and visit our website without submitting any personal information
however, in order to utilize and access specific features, you will be asked to submit your personal information
personal information means information that may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate an individual and may include, but is not limited to, your full name, birth date, email, physical address, telephone number, and gender
we may also infer your general location based on your device’s ip address, which we use to personalize content provided to you on the website and in emails we send to you
for example, when you open an account or place an order, we may collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide
your full name, billing address, shipping address, email address, and telephone number
when you choose to log-in and connect your social media account, such as facebook, to your website account, we collect public information about you from that social media website and non-public information (such as your email address) with your permission
we collect your email address and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter, and we collect your mobile number if you send a text message to us to opt into receiving text messages from us
when you make payments through the website, you will need to provide financial account information, such as your credit card number, to our third-party service providers
we do not collect or store such information, though we will receive information about completed transactions that does not include credit card numbers
in certain areas of the website, you may be asked to provide personal information in connection with registration for community postings (i
, chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, employment applications, or customer service requests, among other reasons
when we run a contest or sweepstakes on or relating to our website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules
the rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this statement
we may also gather certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of our website ("usage information")
generally, this information is collected through "traffic data
" we collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with our website
for example, we collect your ip address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit our website
we also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage
this information is used to analyze and improve our website, provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience, and personalize the website, our communications with you, and your shopping experience
how do we use cookies and similar technology, advertising, and online tracking
like many websites, we and our third-party partners, such as advertising networks, social media widgets, and analytics providers, use "cookies" – files stored on a computer’s hard drive by a browser, and other similar technology to provide, monitor, and customize the website and its usage and our email communications to you
cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when you leave the website without checking out and to send you email communications about your activity on the website, shopping orders, and other shopping opportunities
for example, we may send you emails to remind you about unpurchased items in your shopping cart or to notify you that an item in your shopping cart has changed in price, and we can determine whether the messages were opened
our partners also may collect and combine information about your online activities over time, on other devices, and on other websites or apps, if those websites and apps also use the same partners
our partners may use the information to tailor advertisements shown to you for goods and services on the website, on other websites and apps, and in email communications
we do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this statement
for example, we use google analytics and google adwords, among other analytics and online advertising tools, on the website to collect usage information, to analyze how users use the website and to provide advertisements to you on the website and on other websites
for more information about how to opt out of having your information used by google analytics, visit https
you may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements on this browser or device from advertisers, or other advertising networks who are members of the network advertising initiative or who subscribe to the digital advertising alliance’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising by visiting the opt-out options of each of those organizations

when you opt out of personalized advertising, you may continue to see online advertising on the site and/or our ads on other websites and online services
we recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping and website experience
most browsers have options that allow you to choose which cookies may be placed on your device, alert you when cookies are being sent, and to delete or disable cookies
please note though that setting a browser to reject cookies may limit your experience on the website
the website does not respond to browser do-not-track signals
how do we use your information
we use information for internal and service-related purposes, including to provide and improve the website and any of our products and services
for example, we may use your personal information to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, to send you direct mail marketing communications (e
, a catalog), to provide other services to you, and to personalize the website, our communications with you, and your shopping experience
your information also may be used to contact you about sales, new products and services (from us or others), new website features, special offers, and personalized offers based on your address or general location based on your computer’s ip address, unless you have opted to not receive promotional communications
we may also combine your offline purchase history data with personal information we collect online so that we may effectively market our products and services to you
combining data allows reebok to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide you with product recommendations and special offers
we use non-personally identifiable usage information to help us determine how people use parts of the website and who our visitors are
this allows us to improve our website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible

with third-party service providers
