0 out of 5 stars not useful
september 10, 2018 i had a totally different concept in mind for what this would be
i used it to remind me to feed the dog when i was finished with some chores
once, maybe twice (5 minute intervals) while i was still busy (due to the timer setting)
but when i was actually done, no nagging was done
i don't know if the skill cut off due to the 30 minute timer or if it was just "done"
either way, the skill didn't do what i expected

0 out of 5 stars i agree with other reviewers
july 13, 2018 i agree with previous reviewers
enabling this at a specific time would be much more helpful
i’ll disable the skill until then

0 out of 5 stars works as advertised when you follow the instructions
april 2, 2018 works as advertised when you follow the instructions
also i really like the sassy and conversational tone of the nagging
very creative and well-written
i use it for about ten minutes, and then don't respond when she checks in--so she stops
it keeps me moving

0 out of 5 stars great potential
march 29, 2018 i can see lots of uses for this in a busy situation
enhancements could include a generic 'nag' even if alexa doesn't know the topic or multiple concurrent 'nags'
