by participating in the on demand travel credit trial ( odtc trial ) you consent to tfnsw collecting, using, storing and disclosing your personal information in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice
the provision of your personal information is voluntary, but you may not participate in the odtc trial if you do not provide the personal information required in order for tfnsw to link your trips
tfnsw will collect your name, email address, mobile telephone number and opal card number directly from you when you register to participate in the odtc trial
tfnsw will also collect personal information about you from interline connect (such as trip information including the date, time and location of your interline connect trip, the cost of your interline connect ticket and ticket type (for example, adult or concession) and specific customer reference numbers designated to your interline connect account)

the odtc trial requires a customer to register a new account with tfnsw for an on demand travel credit ( odtc trial account )
certain personal information about you (set out above under collection ) will be used to link your opal card and your interline on demand booking account number
once linked, tfnsw will consolidate your interline on demand and opal trips and calculate travel credits for the intermodal transfers between interline on demand and opal trips
you can view your consolidated travel history for interline on demand trips and connected opal trips, by logging in to your on demand travel credit account and viewing your activity

when you board the interline on demand bus service, tfnsw will be notified of this trip by an exchange of the information above
once you tap on or off at an opal network service at edmondson park station, your information in relation to tapping on or off the opal network and the interline on demand bus trip you took will be linked in your odtc trial account held by tfnsw
tfnsw will verify that you have travelled on the interline on demand bus service and the opal network within 60 minutes
at that time, you will be eligible to receive a credit of $2
00 if you are an adult opal customer or $1
