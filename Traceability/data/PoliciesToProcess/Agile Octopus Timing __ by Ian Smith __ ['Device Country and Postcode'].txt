agile octopus timing – privacy policy
this document is the privacy policy for the published version of the agile octopus timing alexa skill that can be accessed through the alexa platform
it was last updated in may 2020
ian smith provides the agile octopus timing alexa skill (“the skill”), as a free service that is made available without obligation
it is made available in the hope that it will enable greener and more cost-effective electricity usage for customers of the agile octopus tariff provided by octopus energy
the first time you invoke the skill, it will ask you to visit the alexa app to authorise it to access your country and postcode information
your postcode is required in order to determine your electricity region, as different regions have different unit prices
subsequently, each time you invoke the skill, it will request your postcode from amazon
the skill does not store your postcode and instead requests it from amazon on each invocation
you may rescind this authorisation at any time in the alexa app
if you do so, the skill will seek permission from you again the next time you use it
the skill communicates with octopus energy via the publicly available octopus energy api , which is a programming interface that allows the skill to retrieve information from octopus energy
at this time, octopus energy does not require any identifying account information to access the data used by this skill
therefore, no information specific to any account that you may hold with octopus energy is currently required or used
on each invocation, your postcode is sent to octopus energy for the purpose mentioned above, of determining your electricity region
the skill creates log entries, stored on amazon’s servers, that are designed to help highlight and then subsequently debug problems that may occur with the skill
if there is a problem with postcode lookup when you use the skill, your postcode may appear in a log file
these log entries cannot be connected back to you or your alexa device
the logs are configured to be retained for 90 days and will then be automatically deleted
