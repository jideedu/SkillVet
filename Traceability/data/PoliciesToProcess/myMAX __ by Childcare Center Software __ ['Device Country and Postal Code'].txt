why am i seeing ads by google for products i’ve viewed
our website uses a remarketing advertising service
our remarketing service is provided by google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the internet
with remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at
as an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website
the website’s owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit
we use remarketing for similar purposes, so you may see advertisements for our products as you search the internet
for this to happen google or other remarketing providers will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing
(this can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen)
when you visit another website that works with google or other providers of remarketing advertising, you may see ads for products that you previously viewed, even though they may have nothing to do with the website you are seeing the ads on
so going back to the computer example, you may see ads for computers on a news or weather website
this happens because your browser is sending google the same cookie and encouraging you to revisit the computer website that you previously visited to buy a computer
you can opt out of google’s use of cookies by visiting
why am i seeing ads by for products i’ve viewed
