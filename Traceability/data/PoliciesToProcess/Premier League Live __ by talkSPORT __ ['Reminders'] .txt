understanding when our audiences engage with us or other organisations
to build a clearer understanding of who our audiences are in order to better serve them

to demonstrate that we provide services and products to agreed industry standards
we rely on these legitimate interests to
monitor, improve and protect our products, content, services and websites, online and offline
this includes using information about your app download to validate free trials
we sometimes make assumptions about your interests and preferences based on the way you interact with our products and services and the information we hold about you
knowing these interests and preferences allows us to understand the products, content and services our customers like, letting us focus our efforts on developing those areas
we may also use this information to make decisions about what direct marketing and advertising to show you
content recommendations we may also use your information to optimise article and content recommendations
based on the kind of articles and content which prove to be of interest to you
to build and manage direct marketing campaigns
we use your information to create engaging and relevant marketing campaigns promoting products and services we think you will like from our brands and partners
the use of your information to do this is usually based on a legitimate interest, however, we will ask your permission if we want to deliver direct marketing to you
you will be able to change your marketing preferences in your preference centre or in the communications you are sent
to send product related and similar product and services communications
for certain types of marketing communications, we do not require your consent and we instead rely on our legitimate interest

audience segmentation and creation
we may use the information we hold about you, including how you engage with our products and services, as well as from other sources, to segment our audiences into groups with particular attributes (likes/dislikes/reading behaviours etc)
this helps us personalise your experience and show you more relevant content and adverts
when you visit our sites, we may check your device to see if a cookie id has been assigned to it
this is a form of identifier that tells us who is visiting our sites
we are then able to compare the cookie id we have for you with ids that our advertisers hold to see if we both know who you are
by knowing it is you (or your device), the advertiser can decide if they want to advertise to you and if so, what advertising would be relevant
see the section on cookies & similar technologies for more information
from time to time we may allow our clients to compare their customer database to ours
this is called data matching and allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms
generally this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights
these insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client and other information that would be useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective
as part of the data matching process we may allow partners to build target audiences based on pre-defined attributes
these ‘lookalike’ audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences
for example, a sports brand may want to reach ‘sports enthusiasts’ or those who enjoy ‘outdoor pursuits’
they could select audiences who have been identified as having an interest in these areas
to do this, we segment our audiences into groups depending on what we think they like or other behaviours
this helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising
we may collect information from your devices that tells us whether you are using an ad blocker
this is so that we can manage our compliance with the law and also determine if we are able to show you advertising
we may also ask you to suspend or whitelist our sites so that we can show you adverts
as a predominantly advertising funded business, we do rely on our ability to show you advertising to help ensure we are able to provide you with the products and services you request
