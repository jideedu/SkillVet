our privacy policy how we keep your personal information safe
hello, we’re the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, though you probably know us as the nspcc
we're the leading children's charity fighting to end child abuse in the uk, channel islands and isle of man
we help children who have been abused to rebuild their lives, protect those at risk, and find the best ways of preventing abuse from ever happening
safety is at the heart of everything we do
our mission is to keep children safe across the uk – it’s what drives all our work
but, as one of our valued supporters, service users or affiliates that also extends to keeping your personal information safe
at the nspcc we value anyone who comes into contact with us and we’re committed to protecting your privacy so we make sure we protect any of your personal data that we have
this page, together with our terms of use for this site and our cookies policy , will let you know exactly how we use and protect your personal information
if you use childline, you can find more about how they use your personal data by visiting the childline privacy policy
and if you have any questions about it please just send us an email at dataprotectionofficer@nspcc
uk - we’d be delighted to help
our postal address can be found in the “contact us” section of this page
the nspcc is registered under the data protection act 2018 under number z6593104 and for the purposes of this policy is the data controller
our registered charity numbers are 216401 in england and wales and sc037717 in scotland
the nspcc trading company ltd
(registered company in england & wales no
890446) is a wholly owned subsidiary of ours which trades on our behalf
we have appointed a dpo at dpo centre limited, 50 liverpool st, london ec2m 7py
below we have answered a range of questions to help you better understand how we protect your personal information
this policy was last updated on 3 june 2019
what information do we collect
personal information is any information that can be used to identify you
so for example, if you donate money, use our services, request our products, or become involved in our campaigns or volunteering work, we will collect and process the personal information that you’ve provided
we may also collect information from you when you report a problem with our website, if you complete a survey which we use for research or evaluation purposes, or if you give us your details as part of a report to our helpline
this personal information may include
basic personal details (your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number and date of birth)
financial details (bank account number, uk tax payer information for gift aid)
credit or debit card information
photos, videos or audio recordings used as part of our work with you
cctv which is in use at various nspcc sites
in certain circumstances we will process special category data, for example if you're involved with any of our service provisions, to help ensure our work respects your needs
we may also collect details of your visits to our website, for example location data, how you found us and the resources accessed on our website
we use this to provide you with the information, services or products that you’re interested in and are most relevant to you
to understand how we use information about the communications devices you use, such as ip address (the location of the computer on the internet) and cookies, please see our cookies policy page
how do we use your personal information
there are a number of ways that we may use your personal information, all to help us provide the most relevant and personalised service for you
the following are some of the ways we use your personal information for our core activities
to provide you with information (such as fundraising or campaigning activities), services or products you’ve requested or which we feel may interest you
we may also permit selected third parties to provide you with information on our behalf
but all this will only happen when you’ve consented to this
for more information, please see “sharing your information with third parties” below
to provide key services for safeguarding of children as part of children’s and national services
to enable us to support you in our work with you
sometimes we may use mobile phones, cameras or laptops for filming, voice recording or slideshows as part of our work with you
these may be used to improve your relationships or help you understand our work better, and may also be used to help our workers learn how to support you better
to evaluate and improve our fundraising activities as well as the services we provide to children and families
this could be analysing demographics to inform our campaign, marketing and service provision strategies
this helps us ensure we understand how effective our services are and ensures we spend our charitable donations in the most effective way
if you start using an nspcc service, we may continue to use your data for evaluation purposes, but this will be in aggregate form and will not identify you as an individual
to analyse and improve the services offered on our websites
this means we can provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience we can, which may involve providing your information to third parties
to allow you to participate in interactive features on our website, when you choose to do so
for example, we may help you auto-complete forms by inserting your contact details for you to edit
to use your ip addresses to identify relevant information
this may include information such as your approximate location
it also helps us to block disruptive use or establish information like the number of visits to the website from different countries
to make our marketing campaigns more targeted and relevant to potential donors and customers
to conduct prospect research
for more information please see the prospect research section below
to promote our activities
where you have given us your consent we may use photos of you, or testimonials, for promotional activities and communications
to match information collected from you through different means or at different times
that could include using information collected online and offline, along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties and publicly available sources, to ensure that the information we hold about you is up to date and accurate
these include third parties such as bt osis, post office address file and experian quick address
to protect staff and visitors to nspcc sites
to protect staff, visitors and to protect the organisation against theft, some sites will have cctv installed
some of these activities may also involve ‘automated decision-making’
however, you have the right to object to the use of your personal information for profiling and automated decision-making processes
for information on how to exercise these rights, please see the section on ‘your rights’ below
if you do not want us to use your data for direct marketing purposes you can contact our supporter care team
please see "how will we contact you
prospect research (tab content hidden)
we conduct prospect research to identify new potential donors and existing supporters who may be interested in supporting the nspcc with a major gift
in certain circumstances, this means that we might collect or supplement personal data about you before we meet you to understand whether it would be appropriate to take such an approach
we only use information from credible sources in the public domain, and we never use third parties to conduct research on our behalf
we do not seek consent to conduct this research, but rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis
we will always tell you if this research has been conducted and ensure you have the opportunity to ask for this information to be deleted
our lawful basis for using your personal data (tab content hidden)
data protection law requires us to have a reason or justification, also known as a ‘lawful basis’, for using any of your personal data
consent this is where we've asked for your permission to use your personal data in a specific way, and you've agreed
for example to send you marketing via email or sms
contract we may process your personal data as part of an agreement you have with us
for example if you work for us or if you purchase something from our online shop
legal obligation we may collect or share your personal data where we are required to do so by law
for example to fulfil a regulatory requirement or for fraud detection
vital interests where there's an immediate risk to your health we may use your personal data
for example if we're concerned for your health or safety at one of our fundraising events
some activities are undertaken in the public interest
for example collecting personal information in relation to concerns raised via the nspcc helpline
legitimate interests we rely on legitimate interests when we have an interest in processing your personal data, which is not outweighed by your own rights and freedoms
whenever we use this justification we'll always conduct a balancing exercise to ensure that we consider the impact on you as an individual
activities relying on legitimate interests might include sending you direct marketing via post, or conducting research in order to improve the services we offer to families
sharing your information with third parties - keeping your information safe (tab content hidden)
we will not rent or sell your personal information to other organisations for use by them in any way, including in their own direct marketing activities
we may disclose your personal information to third parties if we're legally obliged to
or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use for this website or other agreements
or to protect the rights, property or safety of the nspcc, our donors or others
this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud detection and protection, or with local authorities or social services for the purposes of the provision of health, legal or social care or treatment
we may ask other organisations to look at how well our services work, which might mean sharing some of your information, such as dates of birth, ethnicity, religious beliefs, so we can make sure our services work well and for people from all different backgrounds
this information will be shared in a way that does not identify you
sometimes we cannot keep information confidential as we need to ensure all children, young people and vulnerable adults are safe
this means that if you tell us anything about yourself or another person being hurt or at risk of being hurt we might need to tell someone who can help (such as a social worker, parent or teacher)
sometimes the court might order us to share information and you might ask us to share information on your behalf
if your local authority or another agency, such as your school or the police, have asked us to work with you we will need to gain information from them about you and share information with them and then we will need to let them know the outcome of our work
we will tell you who we are sharing your information with and why, unless it is a concern as mentioned above or we do not think it is safe to do so
sometimes we might want to tell your carer, social worker or someone else about how things are going while you are working with us, but we will always check this out with you first, unless we think it is not safe to do so
we may ask you to complete a checklist which we send to another organisation, once we have removed any information that could identify you, and they provide us with a report to help us understand what will help you best
however, where you have given us permission to contact you, we may pass on your information to external service providers to contact you on our behalf
for example, we may pass on your personal information to telemarketing companies such as dtv optimise or mango to conduct campaigns on our behalf
we may ask external service providers to carry out tracking and analysis on our behalf as described in the cookies policy
for instance, we may pass on hashed out digital data (such as ip addresses) to our media agency omd to monitor how well our campaigns are performing
where we use an external service provider to act on our behalf, we will disclose only the personal information necessary to deliver the service and will have a contract in place that requires the provider to comply with nspcc data protection and information security requirements
how long will we keep your personal information
we always have your best interests at heart and your personal information will not be retained by the nspcc for longer than necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected, or for which it was further processed
we're legally required to hold some personal information to fulfil statutory obligations
for example the collection of gift aid or to support certain financial transactions
we may be asked to keep records for longer periods or receive statutory instruction not to delete records
if you've used any of our services supporting children and families, for example baby steps or letting the future in, we will make notes of the work we do
we will keep these notes for 25 or 75 years depending on the nature of our work and your circumstances
for more information, or to request a copy of our data retention policy, please contact our data protection team at dataprotectionoffice@nspcc
remarketing (tab content hidden)
additionally the nspcc may pass on your personal information to online advertising tools, including facebook custom audiences, google adwords match and google analytics to carry out ‘remarketing activities’
this means that if you’ve already visited our website we can direct you back to it through ads shown on sites across the internet by third-party vendors, including google and facebook
these third party vendors may use cookies to serve these ads based on your past visits to our website
you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the network advertising initiative’s opt-out page
making our communications relevant to you (tab content hidden)
we want to ensure that we provide you with information that is relevant to you
in order to do this, we may need to analyse the information we hold on you for supporter analysis and data quality purposes
this analysis includes modelling (e
how likely you are to respond to the invitation) and segmenting (looking at people who are similar to you), so that you receive targeted and relevant communication
this ensures we can spend our charitable donations effectively to obtain the biggest impact for children
additionally, as our data is captured from various different sources (e
donation or through our website, campaign data), for data quality purposes we will analyse your data to ensure we do not have unnecessary multiple versions of information on the same person on our database
using third parties to update our records (tab content hidden)
in carrying out the above activities, we may from time to time use publicly available information or information gathered from specialist companies
these include directory of social change and ukchanges
companies that collate and analyse information from public registers to help ensure we have accurate and up to date information about our supporters
these companies may have obtained this information directly from you and in circumstances where you legitimately expect that they will pass on your information to other entities
we will only use data collected in this manner for purposes to which you have consented or, if this is not reasonably practical, where we believe it is reasonably necessary to process your personal information for the purposes for which it has been provided
throughout all of this we will always ensure that the privacy and security of your personal information is protected
how do we handle your direct debit or credit card information
the nspcc will ensure that when collecting information such as debit cards, credit cards or personal information that this done so securely
we and our partners use tls (transport level security) to encrypt data sent between the customer and us or our partners
the nspcc is pci compliant and uses external payment card industry (pci) compliant providers to collect this data on our behalf
we do not store pci data on our own systems

the personal information collected from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the european economic area ("eea")
it may also be processed by individuals operating outside the eea who work for us or working on our behalf
this includes staff engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services

where data is transferred outside the eea, we have gone through a full due diligence process to help ensure the data is afforded the same levels of security

this information may come directly from you, or it may come from a third party that we consider is legitimate and trustworthy and in circumstances where it is appropriate and where you will have had a clear expectation that your details would be passed on for this purpose
we may also combine the information you provide us with information we collect from trusted third parties and partners such as business partners, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies as well as publicly available sources
