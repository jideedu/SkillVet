suppliers and our international partners
we will need to send details of your booking to the suppliers such as cruise line, hotel, airline, tour operators etc
suppliers may make decisions themselves about how and why to process your information, or they may or may not process your information on our behalf

profiling and personalized marketing
we think it is important for us to understand the types of vacations that our consumers are interested in so that we can make our marketing relevant and targeted
to do this, we use your personal data to build a profile for you that lets us work out which of our marketing segments is the best fit for you
the personal data we use
from the personal data that we hold about you, our model may consider your age, gender, household or travel composition, postcode, how you have interacted with our websites and marketing emails and your booking history (including your destinations, the suppliers you prefer and your chosen accommodation)
we do not always use all of these data categories if we do not have the information about you or it is not relevant for our marketing activities
how we build your profile and what we learn from it
statistical analysis - we use the data to learn about your previous or likely future booking behavior, for example
(i) the value or likely value of the bookings you make with us
(ii) whether you tend to re-book within 12 months of your last trip and the destinations that you tend to book
(iii) the extent to which you engage with our marketing emails
marketing segments – we try to match consumers with one or more pre-defined segments that allow us to broadly tailor our marketing messages for the right audience
we define our segments using anonymized demographic data based on broad characteristics and behaviors such as age, household income, or location
you may share a segment with other consumers, so this process is generally not highly individualized
let’s say you have just signed up on our websites (giving us your contact details) and you have never booked a trip with us before
over the next few days you search for vacation packages that are generally popular with families (giving us website interaction data)
we might use that data to add you to one of our family segments so that you get relevant emails from us
what this means for you
tailoring our marketing campaigns to your profile or segment means you should receive more relevant communications from us
that’s good for us because we think you are more likely to book a vacation that matches your requirements
we hope that’s good for you, too, because it helps you to find the vacations that you are interested in
we might also send you special offers on your birthday
targeted advertising on third party social media platforms and websites
we may share your personal data – including your name, email address, address and date of birth – with third party social media platforms, including facebook, and websites for the purposes of allowing those platforms to display targeted advertisements to you
you can ask us not to share your personal data with platforms, but you will need to contact the platform with any requests in relation to how the platform uses your personal data because we do not control that

you are in control of your personal data
