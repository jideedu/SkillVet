we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so
- how long will you use my personal data for
we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements
to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements
by law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes

you have the right to
request access - the right to access the personal information we hold about you

request correction - the right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you (although you can probably do most of this through your account)
request deletion - the right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it
you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law
note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request
request transfer - the right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider
we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format
note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you
object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms
in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms
request restriction of processing - this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios
(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data
however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent
if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you
we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent
where you receive direct marketing messages from hermes, you can withdraw your consent directly via the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the email or via your account settings
no fee usually required
you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights)
however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive
alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances
what we may need from you
we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights)
this is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it
we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response
time limit to respond
we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month
occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests
in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated
