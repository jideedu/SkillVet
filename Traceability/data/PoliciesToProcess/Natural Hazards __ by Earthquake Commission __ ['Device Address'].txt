this includes any forms, websites, online services, applications and claims, whether online, over the phone or in person
personal information is information about an identifiable individual, and includes someone's name, contact details and address
this privacy statement has been developed to inform you about our approach to privacy and relevant legislation, including the earthquake commission act 1993 (the eqc act) and the privacy act 1993 which set out how we can collect, use, disclose, store and provide access to personal information
why we collect personal information

we collect and use personal information to verify your identity, provide you with eqcover (eqc’s natural disaster insurance), manage, assess and settle your claim
we may also use it for training, and research and statistical purposes or for any other purpose that is authorised by you
we may also make available any information in our possession if we believe on reasonable grounds that doing so is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to public health or public safety or to the life or health of any individual
