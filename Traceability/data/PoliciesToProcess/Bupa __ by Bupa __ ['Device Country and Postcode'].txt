what we use your personal information for
we process your personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy notice
we have also set out some legal reasons why we may process your personal information (these depend on what category of personal information we are processing)
we normally process standard personal information if this is necessary to provide the services set out in a contract, it is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests or it is required or allowed by any law that applies
please see below for more information about this and the reasons why we may need to process special category information
by law, we must have a lawful reason for processing your personal information
we process standard personal information about you if this is
necessary to provide the services set out in a contract − if we have a contract with you, we will process your personal information in order to fulfil that contract (that is, to provide you and your dependants with our products and services)
in our or a third party’s legitimate interests − details of those legitimate interests are set out in more detail in the ‘legitimate interest’ section below
required or allowed by law
we process special category information about you because
it is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine , to assess whether you are able to work, medical diagnosis, to provide health or social care or treatment, or to manage health-care or social-care systems (including to monitor whether we are meeting expectations relating to our clinical and non-clinical performance)
it is necessary for an insurance purpose (for example, advising on, arranging, providing or managing an insurance contract, dealing with a claim made under an insurance contract, or relating to rights and responsibilities arising in connection with an insurance contract or law)
it is necessary to establish, make or defend legal claims (for example, claims against us for insurance)
it is necessary for the purposes of preventing or detecting an unlawful act in circumstances where we must carry out checks without your permission so as not to affect the outcome of those checks (for example, anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering checks or to check other unlawful behaviour, or carry out investigations with other insurers and third parties for the purpose of detecting fraud)
it is necessary for a purpose designed to protect the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously improper behaviour (for example, investigations in response to a safeguarding concern, a member's complaint or a regulator (such as the care quality commission or the general medical council) telling us about an issue)
it is in the public interest, in line with any laws that apply
it is information that you have made public
we have your permission
as is best practice, we will only ask you for permission to process your personal information if there is no other legal reason to process it
if we need to ask for your permission, we will make it clear that this is what we are asking for, and ask you to confirm your choice to give us that permission
if we cannot provide a product or service without your permission (for example, we can’t manage and run a health trust without health information), we will make this clear when we ask for your permission
if you later withdraw your permission, we will no longer be able to provide you with a product or service that relies on having your permission
we process your personal information for a number of legitimate interests, including managing all aspects of our relationship with you, for marketing, to help us improve our services and products, and in order to exercise our rights or handle claims
more detailed information about our legitimate interests is set out below
legitimate interest is one of the legal reasons why we may process your personal information
taking into account your interests, rights and freedoms, legitimate interests which allow us to process your personal information include
to manage our relationship with you, our business and third parties who provide products or services for us (for example, to check that you have received a service that you’re covered for, to validate invoices and so on)
to provide health-care services on behalf of a third party (for example, your employer)
to make sure that claims are handled efficiently and to investigate complaints (for example, we may ask your treatment provider for information to make sure we receive accurate information and to monitor the quality of your treatment and care)
to keep our records up to date and to provide you with marketing as allowed by law
to develop and carry out marketing activities and to show you information that is of interest to you, based on our understanding of your preferences (we combine information you give us with information we receive about you from third parties to help us understand you better)
for statistical research and analysis so that we can monitor and improve products, services, websites and apps, or develop new ones
to contact you about market research we are carrying out
to monitor how well we are meeting our clinical and non-clinical performance expectations in the case of health-care providers
to enforce or apply our website terms of use, our policy terms and conditions or other contracts, or to protect our (or our customers’ or other people’s) rights, property or safety
to exercise our rights, to defend ourselves from claims and to keep to laws and regulations that apply to us and the third parties we work with
to take part in, or be the subject of, any sale, purchase, merger or takeover of all or part of the bupa business
we may use your personal information to send you marketing by post, by phone, through social media, by email and by text
we can only use your personal information to send you marketing material if we have your permission or a legitimate interest as described above
if you don’t want to receive emails from us, you can click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in all emails we send
if you don’t want to receive texts from us you can tell us by contacting us at any time
otherwise, you can always contact us to update your contact preferences
you have the right to object to direct marketing and profiling (the automated processing of your information to help us evaluate certain things about you, for example, your personal preferences and your interests) relating to direct marketing
please see the section about your rights for more details
processing for profiling and automated decision-making
like many businesses, we sometimes use automation to provide you with a quicker, better, more consistent and fair service, and marketing information we think will be of interest to you (including discounts on our products and services)
this will involve evaluating information about you and, in some cases, using technology to provide you with automatic responses or decisions (automated decisions)
you can click below for more information about this
you have the right to object to direct marketing and profiling relating to direct marketing
you may also have the right to object to other types of profiling and automated decision-making set out below
in these cases, you have the right to ask us to make sure that one of our advisers reviews an automated decision, to let us know how you feel about it and to ask us to reconsider the decision
you can contact us to exercise these rights
by law, we must tell you about
automated decision-making (making a decision using technology, without any person being involved)
profiling (automated processing of your information to help us evaluate certain things about you, for example, your personal preferences and your interests)
this is because you have certain rights relating to both automated decision-making and profiling
you have the right to object to profiling relating to direct marketing
if you do this, we will no longer carry out profiling for direct marketing purposes
you also have the right to object to profiling in other circumstances set out below
when we make decisions using only automated processing which produce legal effects which concern you or which have a significant effect on you, we will let you know
you then have 21 days to ask us to reconsider our decision or to make a new decision that is not based only on automated processing
if we receive a request from you, within 21 days of receiving your request, we will
consider the request, including any information you have provided that is relevant to it
let you know in writing what we have done to meet your request, and the outcome
you can contact us to ask about these rights
for more information on all your rights, please read the ‘your rights’ section below
profiling and automated decision-making
the processes set out below involve both profiling and automated decision-making
depending on the type of health-insurance product that you want to benefit from, to help us decide what level of cover we can offer you, we will ask you to provide information about your medical history
we may use software to review this information to find out whether you have any previous or existing health conditions which we cannot cover you for and which will be excluded from your policy
we may use software to help us calculate the price of products and services based on what we know about you and other customers
for example, our technology may analyse information about your claims history and compare it with the information we hold about previous claims to evaluate how likely you are to need to make a claim
we may also evaluate your age, where you live and other details relating to your health (such as existing health conditions and whether you smoke) to calculate prices for community-rated products which are based on predefined groups with similar risk profiles
the processes set out below involve profiling
in order to improve outcomes and be more efficient, and allow us to offer advice about different treatment paths (for example, alternatives to surgery or other invasive treatments), we may use software to evaluate medical history and information about the general population in an area to identify customers who are likely to need that advice most
when your policy is due for renewal, our software tells us this and may also evaluate your payment and claims history, information about the general information in a particular area, and other information from third parties to automatically provide you with information about what incentives we can offer you and the marketing messages you will receive
we ask other organisations to carry out some of our consumer and market analysis to improve our marketing processes
this involves sharing personal information relating to our customers with third parties who specialise in profiling and segmenting people (putting people into groups of different types of customer, based on different kinds of information collected about them, to help us to better target our products to them)
these companies match the information we give them with information they get from other sources to improve the accuracy of their analysis
we use the results of this analysis to help us target marketing and offers
we may use information about the products you have bought, and information about what other customers who have bought the same products you have bought, to make sure we send you information about the products you are most likely to be interested in
we may share your personal information (including your name, date of birth, sex and the country you live in) with third-party companies, such as finscan, who we use to carry out anti-fraud checks
we will review any matches from this process
(we will not use automated

a cookie, also known as a browser cookie, is a text file containing small amounts of information which a server may download to your computer hard drive, tablet or mobile device when you visit a website or use an app
there are different types of cookies which are used to do different things
these include letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience
others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests, or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit
‘first party’ and ‘third party’ cookies
cookies can be set and controlled by the operator of the website which the user is browsing such as bupa for this website (known as a ‘first party cookie’) or a third party such as facebook, for example to display advertisements and social sharing features, (known as a ‘third party cookie’)
due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of the bupa website, such as generating a quote or placing an order
broadly speaking, there are two different types of browser cookie
(1) session cookies are stored in the computer's memory during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user's computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended
these cookies usually store a session id that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly

for example to keep track of items that a consumer has added to a shopping basket
session cookies do not collect any information from the user's computer and they expire at the end of the user's browser session
they can also become inaccessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 or 30 minutes
(2) persistent cookies are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed
persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions
persistent cookies usually assign a unique id to the user’s browser and they are usually configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of time, from days to months or even years
