0 out of 5 stars integrative, interactive, immersive march 2, 2019 this was an awesome experience
i got the email and read the quote, "alexa, open the division network
" outloud and my girlfriend's alexa device heard me
of course, i continued with it (without requesting her approval) and we both listened to the narrative
we were both surprised with how deep and integrated a game (this game) was becoming
i mean, a division network skill on the amazon alexa device
i felt it was almost like an audio book or an extension to the game's storyline
i don't have an alexa, but i'm definitely getting one now
can't wait to play the open beta when i get back to my house
again, great feature to what seems like is already an amazing game

0 out of 5 stars this is marketing done right
march 6, 2019 as a big fan of the division, i was blown away by by this
the attention to detail is on point
when you first access the skill alexa begins to respond with being unable to then switches to isac and begins to give supplemental content adding to the immersion of the games
this is marketing done right

0 out of 5 stars intense storytelling in installments
march 8, 2019 good grief
this skill is awesome
i had no idea what the division was before i enabled this skill
this skill was one of the promoted skills, so i tried it
it provides a few minutes of intense, well-acted storytelling
is in disarray due to a mysterious disease and the agents are trying to help the president maintain control
i have no idea where the story is going because apparently it is released in installments every few days
looking forward to the next installment on 3/11/19
i think this skill might be a promo leading up to the release of the division 2, a role-playing video game, on 3/15/19
still fun to listen to
uh oh, there were a few potty words (including eff) in the installment
is that all there is to this skill
there have been no installments, aka drops, since 3/11

0 out of 5 stars confirm your identity, agent
may 12, 2019 alexa has 2
2 million skills and i rarely use any of them but i came across this one accident
i enabled the skill on my alexa and was absolutely impressed by the division network skill
it warns you about potentially inappropriate content for children but i'm not sure why - it didn't seem inappropriate to me
not if you've already played either the division or division 2
it's a little immersive when it first starts
alexa is hijacked and the network is initialized
you'll receive a series of field recordings which collectively tell a story in the tom clancy division universe
at the end of each field recording, they will prompt you to continue through some creative way
voice acting is superb
quality enough to be part of the actual game
i haven't gotten all the way through it yet, i want to ration it out and do a couple recordings here and there just in case the field recordings end
i'm going to keep it written down in keep notes so that i never forget about it
i've finally found an alexa skill that i will use, and enjoy using
i liked it so much i might go through other alexa skills to see if there's anything else like it

0 out of 5 stars i love this
march 7, 2019 as a big time division fan this is awesome
it makes you feel feel like your cellphone is going to ring any minute to be activated
^= it really adds to the immersion
pre-ordered the ultimate edition
division 2, and took 12th-14th off from work just so i can binge on this game
it can't get here fast enough,
just counting down the days
just wish i could start this from the beginning
to listen to it again wile i put on my make up for work
good job ubisoft keep it up
