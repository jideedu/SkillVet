about the filtrete™ smart app
the filtrete™ smart app, along with the filtrete™ smart air filter(s) paired to it via bluetooth, gathers information about the types of air filters you use, the air passing through those air filters, the life of those air filters, and information you choose to provide about your home
this allows the app to
recommend when to change your air filters
recommend types of air filters to buy and where to buy them
provide you indoor air quality data, and, if you choose, outdoor air quality data
what information does the app collect
the filtrete™ smart app collects the following types of information
information you give us , including information you provide us so we can identify you (such as your email address, password, name, and profile picture), which you can provide us directly in the app or when you log into the app via a social media or other third party account (such as your facebook or google account)
information about your home that you choose to provide us when you create or update your profile (such as number of air filters in your home, the presence of pets or smokers, and whether anyone in your home has allergies or respiratory conditions)
you give us this information when you provide it to us in the app
please understand that if you choose not to provide all of the information requested by the app, the app may not be able to provide full functionality
for example, if you choose not to provide all of the optional information about your home requested by the app, the app may provide less precise information about the life of your filtrete™ smart air filter and outdoor air quality, and the app may provide tips and alerts less relevant to you and your home
sensor data , meaning data collected through the sensor on your filtrete™ smart air filter
sensor data may include information about air pressure and temperature, filter type and size, and when a filter was paired with the app
please understand that if you choose not to enable bluetooth settings on your device, keep the app open in the background, or bring your device within range of the sensor-or if you otherwise choose not to provide all or some of the sensor data requested by the app by limiting certain data collection (if such options are offered)-the app may not be able to provide full functionality

location information , meaning precise real-time location information collected using your device's gps technology, or postal code, if you choose to provide it
the app uses location information to provide you information about outdoor air quality and send relevant tips and alerts
please note that we will not access precise location information from your device unless you grant the app permission to do so
if you choose to grant the app permission to access precise location information, we may also use that information to initiate communication with the filtrete™ smart air filter sensor when you are near your home to provide sensor data to the app more frequently and help provide more precise information about the life of your filtrete™ smart air filter
if you would like to receive outdoor air quality information without providing precise location information, you can provide your postal code to receive outdoor air quality information for your postal code
