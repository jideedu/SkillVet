security, data retention and international data transfers
we know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data
this section sets out some
of the measures we have in place
we take the security of your personal information seriously and
employ technical and organisational measures to protect the integrity and privacy of your personal
we only retain your personal information for clearly established periods
our websites use secure socket layer (ssl) encryption technology to ensure that your information
our web pages will start with https and a padlock will be displayed in front of
the web page name to show that we always encrypt the information that you send us
we maintain and enforce physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection,
storage and disclosure of your personal information
however, whilst we take appropriate technical
and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, please note that we cannot guarantee
the security of any personal data that you transfer over the internet to us
our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose
personal information to you, including in relation to a subject access request
we are committed to ensuring the protection of your payment card details and are compliant with the
payment card industry's data security standard (pci-dss)
payments made via our sites are processed
and managed by specialist payment card companies which are not part of the ocado group
store and display the first six and last four digits of your payment card number, the card type
and the card expiry date
the full payment card number is never stored on any of our systems
and is only stored and processed by one of our payment card processing companies
we keep an encrypted token to represent your card and this token is transmitted to the relevant payment
card processing company during the order processing
we use 3d secure to provide additional fraud protection and to protect your payment card from unauthorised
during the checkout process, you may be asked by 3d secure to provide your verified by visa
or mastercard secure code password
it is important to keep your password secure to prevent fraudulent use of your account
your password to anyone else, and especially to anyone who requests it from you by telephone
we will never do this (more information below)
you should avoid using the same password
for other websites, because if their systems are hacked, the hackers will also be able to access
avoid using common terms for your password such as "password" or "123456"
hackers know the most popular passwords and will try to access accounts using these
try to use a combination of letters and numbers that means something to you so it's easy to remember
but difficult to guess
personal security and identity fraud
using public wifi networks can be risky, and hackers may try to capture your online transactions
you should only connect to networks that you trust
if you use a shared
computer, make sure that you log out once you have finished using the website
criminals and fraudsters create authentic looking but false or "spoof" websites and send
phishing emails to steal confidential information
these emails pretend to be from a legitimate
company and try to trick a person into giving away their personal details (such as user names
and passwords) so that security details can be updated or passwords changed
we will never ask you to provide your personal details via email
if you receive an email like this
that claims to be from us and contains an embedded link and a request for you to enter any personal
details, treat it as suspicious and do not enter any personal information, even if the page appears
if you suspect that your account details are subject to such fraudulent activities,
please let us know by calling our contact centre
we retain your personal information for as long as you are a customer and we need it in order to
fulfil the purposes described above
after you stop being a customer, we may keep your data for
a certain period of time, after which we take steps to delete your personal information or hold
it in a form which no longer identifies you (as we may still need to use your data in an anonymised
format for research and other business purposes)
we may keep your personal information for a number of reasons after you have stopped being a customer
to respond to any questions or complaints, for legal, regulatory or technical
reasons, for research and analytics, to investigate fraudulent activities, and to show that we
if you'd like to know more information about how long we keep your personal information, you'll find
more detail in the box below
we will keep your personal information for as long as you are a customer of the ocado group, which
uk, and for a period of time afterwards
if you stop doing so
here are our time periods for retaining customer information
customers that have registered but never shopped
we keep your personal information for eight
years after the date of first registration
customers that have not shopped for an extended period of time
we keep your personal information
for seven years after the date of your last shop
customers who have asked for their accounts to be closed
we keep your personal information for
seven years after the date your account was closed
we delete call recordings after three months unless we need the data to investigate
fraud, to respond to questions or complaints or for legal reasons
after two years we delete notes made on your account by our call centre
advisors, unless we need the data to investigate fraud, to respond to questions and complaints,
or for legal reasons
sending information outside the european economic area
our operations are based in the uk and the personal data that we collect from you is mainly processed,
stored and used within the uk and other countries in the european economic area (eea)
in order to offer you the best service we can provide, we also work with service providers from
other parts of the world
this means that the data we collect sometimes needs to be transferred,
stored and used by companies operating outside the european economic area who work for us or
one of our service providers
we want you to know that we have taken steps to ensure there is
an appropriate level of security for the processing carried out in these countries, such that
data is protected in the same way as if it was being used within the eea
this includes it going through one of these safeguards
the use of european commission-approved standard contractual clauses in contracts for the transfer
of personal data to third countries
the transfer to organisations that are part of the eu-us privacy shield
this is a framework
that sets privacy standards for data sent between the us and eu countries
those standards are similar to what is used within the eea
binding corporate rules (bcrs)
these rules are like a code of conduct
companies to transfer personal data internationally within the same corporate group to countries
that do not provide an adequate level of protection
transfers to a non-eea country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the eea
you can find out more about the above data protection safeguards on the european commission justice website
for more information on how we safeguard transfers of your personal information, please contact us
your choices and rights
this section explains the choices you have when it comes to receiving marketing communications and
how you can exercise your individual rights in relation to your personal data
you have certain rights in the information we hold about you, including the right to
object to our use of your personal information
request a copy of it, update it or to have it deleted

or stop using your personal information if there is no need for us to keep it
you can also ask
us to restrict the use of your personal information in certain circumstances
known as the 'right to erasure' and the 'right to restrict processing'
we will keep a note of
your name if you ask for your personal data to be erased
you will also need to use a different
email address if you decide to re-register as a customer with us as your old email address will
no longer be valid
there may be reasons why the above rights may be limited in some circumstances
for example, we can
refuse to provide information if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about
another person, if you ask us to delete information which we are required to have by law, have
compelling legitimate interests to keep, or need to access in order to exercise our legal obligations
in such situations, we would only use your information for these purposes and not use or share
your information in other ways
we will always ensure your privacy is protected and data will
always be retained in accordance with the data retention section of this policy
you may be unable to continue using our services if you require us to stop using your personal information,
since this information is necessary for us to accurately fulfil and provide our services
