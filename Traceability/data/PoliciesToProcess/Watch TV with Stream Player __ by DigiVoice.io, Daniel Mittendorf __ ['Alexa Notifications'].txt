0 out of 5 stars adding a local channel january 21, 2019 i have a certain channel that i like to watch when i get ready to work and it wasn't immediately available
as suggested in the instructions, i emailed alexaskill@damido
de, told them what city i live in, what network (fox kmsp channel 9) i wanted, and had an answer within a few hours
twenty four hours later it's working
now i don't have to use my tablet in the kitchen to watch the news
all i have to do is say "alexa, tell stream player to launch channel 68
" daniel will tell you in his email what channel number your station has been assigned to

0 out of 5 stars love this app, but recent update in the past week appears to have made it unusable october 26, 2018 first in for most, i do like this app… in fact, i would dare say that i love this app when it actually is working
that said, over the past week the app has not worked as it had previously
for one thing, the initial channel listing which had previously been expertly listed line by line which you can scroll through from top to bottom has been replaced with their convergence of all the channel graphics all at once
in addition, one is prompted to go to the next menu page to by alexa, but , when you order that exact expression to take you to the second menu, nothing happens
there were definitely more options before to choose from in terms of channels, but i simply can’t get to those options now because i can’t get to the second menu page
in addition, the player seems to pause more during play back or take a moment to catch up and buffer and restart again… definitely seeing much more freezing them before

october 19, 2018 this skill works very well for me

0 out of 5 stars what happened to msnbc
october 25, 2018 i gave this skill a 5-star rating because of how it has performed in the past and because of a specific streaming channel available
i noticed this morning that channel 3 is no longer listed on the stream player site
msnbc was channel 3 and it is no longer available on my amazon show
is msnbc no longer available for streaming
msnbc is the only reason i had been using this skill and would be a big loss
i would appreciate it if the developer would respond to our reviews and confirm that msnbc has been permanently removed or is this just a temporary change where we can look forward to its return in the future

0 out of 5 stars choppy stream fixed
july 19, 2018 day one, show replaced my ipad in the kitchen to watch my faves
my wife was happy
day three, there was a problem
the video stuttered and froze for seconds
my internet download speed was way higher than necessary (175 meg down, 45 meg up) so what went south
i tried to clean my cable connections from the street
i picked a different wifi network in the house, i have 3
then i shut the show off on on
if i have to restart the show every day, i will
this app is great
hey, when my wife is happy, everybody’s happy

0 out of 5 stars i love this skill
thank you, thank you
september 17, 2018 i have the echo show and i get home late some nights so this skill has channels you can browse after you call up the stream player on your device
i have to admit i mostly watch the qvc one, but i don't have a tv in my bedroom so this skill is a huge awesomeness in my life
i would recommend anyone try it
the creator is willing to add channels too

a few minutes in voice 5
0 out of 5 stars love it
this is what these devices were designed for
july 29, 2018 stream player is an awesome skill and it provides the user with a great experience from start to finish
from it's channel guide with logos for easy of use or the ability to listen to the audio from a channel when you are not at a display device
overall, i give it two thumbs up and recommend everyone enable it
