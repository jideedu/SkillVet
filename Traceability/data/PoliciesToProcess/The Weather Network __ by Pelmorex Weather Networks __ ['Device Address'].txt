when you download the app or when a new updated is pushed out you have the option of not consenting to location services

we may share anonymous device ids with third parties for advertising, analytics, to ensure you receive a better consumer experience, in order to better understand our users in general and to guide our product improvements

this will not affect how your device operates and you can find more information about how to do this from your phone manufacturer
if you opt not to share your location, you will continue to see advertising but it will be generic
pelmorex’ offers its services to users for free and as such the compromise is the collection and use of personal information for, in part, targeted advertising
in the event that you would prefer that we not provide you with targeted advertising pelmorex offers a paid app for ios through the apple store which eliminates advertising entirely
