other information you should know

this authority is under a duty to protect the public funds it administers and to this end may use the information that you provide for the prevention and detection of fraud
it may also share your information with other bodies responsible for auditing or administering public funds for these purposes
this will involve regular data matching exercises
data matching is where information held on one computer system is compared electronically with information from one or more other computer systems, for example, the audit commission will compare the information from council tax and the electoral register to identify fraud or error
revenues data, which includes council tax and business rates information, may also be provided to, and used for checks with other council departments where it is needed by them to carry out their functions
for example, data can be used to help identify properties that have been empty for a while to encourage owners to bring them back into use and schools may also check council tax records where there are enquiries relating to pupil admissions
customer names and contact addresses are also being held by doncaster council for the introduction of a single customer account
this will benefit residents in the future by reducing the number of times a customer needs to notify the council of a change
we will tell you more about this as it develops
revenues data may also be shared with other organisations where data protection law allows this to happen
for example, information may be shared with the police, or hm revenues and customs if it is needed to prevent or detect a criminal offence, or carry out a prosecution or to assess or collect any tax or duty
