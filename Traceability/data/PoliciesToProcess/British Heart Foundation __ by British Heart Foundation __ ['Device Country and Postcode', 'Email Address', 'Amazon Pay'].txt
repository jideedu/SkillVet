we may collect personal information to conduct supporter research and this is on occasion through our existing network
we may also analyse information you provide to us with other freely available public information to create a profile of supporter interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information (for more information about this use, see how will you combine and analyse the information we collect about you

how we combine and analyse the information we collect about you
before contacting you, we may use data analysis to interpret your data and predict how likely you are to be interested in or responsive to a particular campaign or fundraising message
where we have identified that you have the capacity and/or affinity to support the british heart foundation at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ' how we use your information') and combine, analyse and compile that information into a profile of you in order to assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way

we may also use any publically available data that you share on social media
we may use additional information such as geographical information for measures of affluence where available
in order to do this efficiently, we may use trusted third party specialist companies that collate and analyse information from public registers alongside statistical social-economic data to automate some of this work
this helps us to understand more about your interests and level of potential engagement or donation
examples of companies who assist us with this process include caci limited (acorn) ( https
uk/ ) and management diagnostics limited (boardex) ( http
you can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our supporter care team or our data protection office as set out in the contact us below

accept donations from you

these individuals will then be shown advertising about the british heart foundation

young person's privacy policy
who is this young person's privacy policy for
this policy is specially aimed at you, if you are a 'young person'

if we are collecting information that says something about you and you can be identified from it, this is called 'personal data'
by law, the british heart foundation (bhf) needs to provide you with this privacy policy to tell more you about
what personal data about you we collect
when we collect that data
what we use that personal data for
who else may handle it
your rights under the law
what personal data does the bhf collect about me
the vast majority of young people's personal data that we collect is through you providing that information with us
we collect personal data in the following ways
information you give us
for example, when you post information on our social media or message boards, make a donation to us or register for an event or you apply to be a volunteer

never to analyse or target (or take any decision) regarding any young person based on their gender, age or ethnic origin
what do we use young people's personal data for
the personal data about young people we receive is normally used for one or more of the following purposes
to provide support to you (or your family) as a young person with a heart condition
to provide information in bhf guides, leaflets or dvds and to send email updates about campaigns or events
to offer support programmes such as teen heart
to enable you to take part in a fundraising activity or event (such as the duke of edinburgh award scheme or school fundraising activities)
you may provide personal data if you take part in a survey or case study
if you agree to take part in a case study, the information we receive about you is used to create a resource to be published on our website or in our heart matters magazine or in our in house volunteer magazine
sometimes we collect and use personal data about a young person in the following limited situations
in relation to the bhf's 'give in celebration' service if they are the person receiving the gift
if we accept a work experience student who is a young person at the bhf or in one of our shops
in connection with the running of our shops
for example, if a young person has committed an offence or had an accident in one of these shops
does bhf share young people's personal data with anyone else
we never sell or give your personal data to anyone else other than
some companies who hold data for us to provide support to our organisation, such as a website hosting company
where the law obliges us to share your data with a public authority, the police or courts or we have to do share data with a professional adviser, such as a lawyer in connection with legal claims
if you agree to take part in a case study, information about you (including any audio or video recording) will need to be sent to the media agency or production company that we use to create the case study
we make sure any company or agency who we give your personal data to, will only do what we tell them with that data and will always respect your privacy and security
how long does bhf hold my data
we keep your personal data only for as long as we need to use it for the purposes set out in this policy
personal information that we no longer need is securely disposed of and/or anonymised so you can no longer be identified from it
some personal information may be retained by us in archives for statistical or historical research purposes although we will do this in a manner that complies with data protection law
we continually review what personal information and records that we hold, and delete what is no longer required
we never store payment card data after the transaction has been complete
what legal basis does bhf have for using my personal data
the law requires us to set out the grounds on which we collect and process your personal data
one or more of the grounds listed below may apply
in many instances, we will rely on obtaining consent, either your consent or the consent or your parent or guardian to use your personal data
what you can consent to

in certain instances, we collect and use your personal information by relying on the legitimate interest ground
this means the processing is necessary for the ‘legitimate interests’ of bhf as it helps us work towards our vision of a world without heart and circulatory disease
we will only rely on this ground where we have balanced the interests of bhf against any potential impact (both positive and negative) on your rights and interests
we would not use your personal data for activities where the interests of bhf are overridden by the impact on you
where we rely on legitimate interests, we are using personal data in a way that people would expect us to, or we have a compelling reason

we may use personal data in relation to a legal claim,
performance of a contract
it may be necessary for us to process your personal data to carry out a contract you have entered into with us
for example, if you would like to donate furniture to bhf, we will need your address to come collect the furniture
what are my legal rights
the law gives you 'data protection rights' to control how we use the personal data we hold about you
in short, you can ask us at any time to
stop using your personal data (or 'forget' about you) in most cases
correct any data we hold

if and when this occurs, usually this is a company in the usa
for more information about this please contact us using the contact us section below
keeping your personal information
we keep your personal information only for as long as we need to use it for the purposes set out in this policy

the purpose for which we hold data and whether there is a legitimate reason for continuing to store it (such as in order to deal with any future legal disputes)
and guidance issued by relevant regulatory authorities including, but not limited to, the information commissioner's office (ico)
personal information that we no longer need is securely disposed of and/or anonymised so you can no longer be identified from it

to process donations we may receive from you
to fundraise in a manner referred to in this policy or that you would reasonably expect
to create an account for you if you register with us
to deliver products or services to you
to process orders from our shops or provide after-sales service
for administration purposes (for example we may contact you regarding a donation you have made or the event you have registered for)
for internal management, such as record keeping of enquiries, feedback or complaints
to invite you to participate in surveys or research (although this is voluntary)
to use ip addresses to identify your approximate location, to block disruptive use, to record website traffic or to personalise the way our information is presented to you
to analyse and improve the online services we offer, to make them as user-friendly as possible
we may collect personal information to conduct supporter research and this is on occasion through our existing network
we may also analyse information you provide to us with other freely available public information to create a profile of supporter interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information (for more information about this use, see how will you combine and analyse the information we collect about you
where collecting and holding your information is required or authorised by law
we may use your personal information for the purposes of credit risk reduction or fraud prevention (using external specialist agencies to help us)
other specific purposes that you may agree to from time to time
if you arrange a bhf furniture collection through amazon alexa, we will contact you by email to arrange a delivery date and ascertain contact details for this purpose
how we combine and analyse the information we collect about you
before contacting you, we may use data analysis to interpret your data and predict how likely you are to be interested in or responsive to a particular campaign or fundraising message
where we have identified that you have the capacity and/or affinity to support the british heart foundation at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ' how we use your information') and combine, analyse and compile that information into a profile of you in order to assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way
we typically look at and combine information published in the media but other commonly used publically available sources including company resources, the electoral register and any data you choose to make public on linkedin such as your professional memberships and networks
we may also use any publically available data that you share on social media
we may use additional information such as geographical information for measures of affluence where available
in order to do this efficiently, we may use trusted third party specialist companies that collate and analyse information from public registers alongside statistical social-economic data to automate some of this work
this helps us to understand more about your interests and level of potential engagement or donation
examples of companies who assist us with this process include caci limited (acorn) ( https
uk/ ) and management diagnostics limited (boardex) ( http
you can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our supporter care team or our data protection office as set out in the contact us below
please note that before seeking or accepting major donations we are required to conduct a minimum level of due diligence
this is in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations and our internal risk management policies and procedures
this means that if you opt out of analysis of your data , we may still conduct some analysis that is required to enable us to
accept donations from you

we have accounts on facebook, twitter, linkedin, instagram and snapchat
we collect donations through facebook fundraisers and facebook donate
where members of the public engage with our posts or publish content relevant to our work, we may like the posts, follow them, reply or write to them
we conduct research on what people say on public social media platforms to better understand how people feel about our sector and to improve our work
this research may be done by staff or companies we work with

the social media platform will also use your profile to identify those with similar characteristics to you who we think may also be interested in finding out more about the work we do
these individuals will then be shown advertising about the british heart foundation
you can object to your information being shared with social media platforms
please contact us at heretohelp@bhf
