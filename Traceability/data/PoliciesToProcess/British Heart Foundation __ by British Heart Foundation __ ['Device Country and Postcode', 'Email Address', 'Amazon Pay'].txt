we may collect personal information to conduct supporter research and this is on occasion through our existing network
we may also analyse information you provide to us with other freely available public information to create a profile of supporter interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information (for more information about this use, see how will you combine and analyse the information we collect about you

how we combine and analyse the information we collect about you
before contacting you, we may use data analysis to interpret your data and predict how likely you are to be interested in or responsive to a particular campaign or fundraising message
where we have identified that you have the capacity and/or affinity to support the british heart foundation at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ' how we use your information') and combine, analyse and compile that information into a profile of you in order to assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way

we may also use any publically available data that you share on social media
we may use additional information such as geographical information for measures of affluence where available
in order to do this efficiently, we may use trusted third party specialist companies that collate and analyse information from public registers alongside statistical social-economic data to automate some of this work
this helps us to understand more about your interests and level of potential engagement or donation
examples of companies who assist us with this process include caci limited (acorn) ( https
uk/ ) and management diagnostics limited (boardex) ( http
you can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our supporter care team or our data protection office as set out in the contact us below

who else may handle it
your rights under the law
what personal data does the bhf collect about me
the vast majority of young people's personal data that we collect is through you providing that information with us

if you agree to take part in a case study, the information we receive about you is used to create a resource to be published on our website or in our heart matters magazine or in our in house volunteer magazine
sometimes we collect and use personal data about a young person in the following limited situations
in relation to the bhf's 'give in celebration' service if they are the person receiving the gift

some companies who hold data for us to provide support to our organisation, such as a website hosting company
where the law obliges us to share your data with a public authority, the police or courts or we have to do share data with a professional adviser, such as a lawyer in connection with legal claims
if you agree to take part in a case study, information about you (including any audio or video recording) will need to be sent to the media agency or production company that we use to create the case study
we make sure any company or agency who we give your personal data to, will only do what we tell them with that data and will always respect your privacy and security

how we combine and analyse the information we collect about you
before contacting you, we may use data analysis to interpret your data and predict how likely you are to be interested in or responsive to a particular campaign or fundraising message
where we have identified that you have the capacity and/or affinity to support the british heart foundation at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ' how we use your information') and combine, analyse and compile that information into a profile of you in order to assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way

we may also use any publically available data that you share on social media
we may use additional information such as geographical information for measures of affluence where available
in order to do this efficiently, we may use trusted third party specialist companies that collate and analyse information from public registers alongside statistical social-economic data to automate some of this work
this helps us to understand more about your interests and level of potential engagement or donation
examples of companies who assist us with this process include caci limited (acorn) ( https
uk/ ) and management diagnostics limited (boardex) ( http
you can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our supporter care team or our data protection office as set out in the contact us below
