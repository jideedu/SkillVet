patient privacy & security
our pledge to protect your privacy
health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses have a strong tradition of safeguarding patient information
however, in today’s world, the old system of paper records in locked filing cabinets is not enough
with information broadly held and transmitted electronically, the privacy & security rule under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) provides clear standards for protecting and securing patient information, while allowing the flow of necessary information for patient care and other important purposes
hipaa also specifies a series of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent the intentional or unintentional use or disclosure of protected health information
these safeguards may include shredding documents containing protected health information before discarding them, securing medical records with lock and key or passcode and limiting access to keys or pass codes
henry ford health system knows that medical information about you is personal and is committed to protecting the privacy of your information

we share your information only to the extent necessary to conduct our business operations, to collect payment for the services we provide you and to comply with the laws that govern health care
