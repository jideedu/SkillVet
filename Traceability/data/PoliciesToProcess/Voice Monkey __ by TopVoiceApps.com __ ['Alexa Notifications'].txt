alexa and alexa device faqs
alexa-enabled echo devices faqs

how do i use alexa
alexa allows you to ask questions and make requests using just your voice
for instance, you can ask alexa a question, such as "what is the weather today in london
", or tell alexa to do something, like "add cat food to my shopping list," or "play jazz
" when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon’s cloud so we can process and respond to your request
you access alexa differently based on the type of device you are using
for “hands free” devices, like amazon echo, you access alexa by saying the wake word (alexa, echo, amazon or computer)
for other devices, like certain fire tablets, you access alexa by pressing a button
is alexa recording all my conversations
by default, echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
what happens when i speak to alexa
when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon’s cloud where we process your request and other information to respond to you
for example, when you ask “alexa, play top hits on amazon music” we use the recording of your request and information from amazon music to play top hits
how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
alexa and echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud
by default, alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
when an alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, alexa performs a "cloud verification" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word
if the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud
if alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream
what about "false wakes"
in some cases, your alexa-enabled device might interpret another word or sound as the wake word (for instance, the name "alex" or someone saying "alexa" on the radio or television)
when this happens, we call that a "false wake
" we have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the faq "how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
anytime your echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your voice history available in the alexa app at settings
alexa privacy or https
can i review and delete my voice recordings
you can review voice recordings associated with your account and delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting privacy in settings in the alexa app or www
from either page, you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically
and you can delete all those voice recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting manage your content and devices
you can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice
once enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by saying "alexa, delete what i just said" or you can delete all the voice recordings from your account for the day by saying "alexa, delete everything i said today
" to enable deletion by voice go to settings
review voice history or https
when enabled, anyone with access to your alexa-enabled devices can ask alexa to delete voice recordings from your account
deleting voice recordings may degrade your alexa experience
if you have changed your default marketplace while using an alexa-enabled product, you will need to perform this step for each marketplace to delete all voice recordings associated with your account
what happens when i delete my voice recordings
when you delete voice recordings associated with your account, we will delete the voice recordings and the text transcripts of your request that you selected from amazon’s cloud
we may still retain other records of your alexa interactions, including records of actions alexa took in response to your request
this allows us, for instance, to continue to provide your reminders, timers, and alarms, process your orders, and show your shopping and to-do lists and messages sent through alexa communications
if your request was processed by an alexa skill, deleting your voice recordings does not delete any information retained by the developer of that skill (skill developers do not receive voice recordings)
for more information on alexa skills, refer to the faq "how do alexa skills work
for more information on removing messages sent through alexa communications, refer to the faq "how do i remove messages from my conversation list
for more information on deleting the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice when you created a voice profile, refer to the faq "how do voice profiles work”
what is alexa's voice history feature
voice history is a feature that allows you to play the audio of your voice recordings that were streamed to the cloud, review the text transcript of what alexa thought you said, and review alexa’s response
this feature can help you better understand how alexa works and what alexa is and is not recording
you can also use it to recall answers alexa gave you previously, such as the name of a restaurant alexa recommended
if alexa makes a mistake, you can use this feature to see what may have gone wrong, such as whether alexa misunderstood a particular word or phrase
you can access alexa’s voice history by visiting settings
review voice history in the alexa app or https
you can also help us improve our voice services by providing feedback within your voice history
how are my voice recordings used
alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience and our services
we associate your requests with your amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other amazon services (e
, so you can ask alexa to read your kindle books and play audiobooks from audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience
for example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps alexa choose what songs to play when you say, "alexa, play music
at times, alexa can provide you with recommendations based on your requests
for example, alexa may recommend alexa skills you might like based on the alexa skills you use
how do my voice recordings improve alexa
alexa is a continuously improving service that is designed to get smarter every day
for example, we use your requests to alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning
training alexa with real world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for alexa to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns, dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where customers use alexa
this training relies in part on supervised machine learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future
for example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the weather in austin can identify that alexa misinterpreted it as a request for the weather in boston
our supervised learning process includes multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy
you can manage the use of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new features by visiting settings
manage how your data improves alexa in the alexa app
how do alexa skills work
skills are voice-driven alexa capabilities
you can view and enable skills in your alexa app and enable certain skills by voice
you can use a skill by saying a specific phrase, called the invocation name
when you use a skill, we may exchange related information with the developer of that skill, such as your answers when you play a trivia skill, your postcode when you ask for the weather, or the content of your requests (but not the voice recordings)
if you make a request to alexa without using a skill invocation name, we may send the content of your request to several skills, and enable and launch the skill we think is best able to respond to your request
the skills portion of your alexa app contains more information about skills, such as applicable privacy policies and terms provided by skill developers
by default, we do not share your personal information with skill developers
you can choose to grant the developer of a skill permission to access additional information associated with your account (such as your name and email address with a restaurant booking skill to make a reservation)
you can see and manage the skills that you granted permission to access specific additional information through settings
alexa privacy or https
how does voice purchasing work
prime members can ask alexa to order or reorder eligible products available for sale through the amazon website
you can also subscribe to eligible services using alexa, or purchase products and services through alexa skills using your default payment and delivery settings
you can require a speakable confirmation code, turn purchasing off, and see product and order details in your alexa app or alexa
uk for those orders
just like orders placed through the amazon website, orders placed through alexa are subject to amazon
uk's conditions of use & sale and, in the case of a subscription for a service, the terms for the applicable service
some alexa skills allow you to purchase non-digital products or services from the developer of the skill (for instance, order food through a restaurant's skill) via amazon pay using your default payment and delivery settings
you can view your amazon pay order history and find additional information for those purchases on the amazon pay website
some other alexa skills allow you to purchase products and services from the developer of the skill using a payment method you provide directly to the developer
your voice purchasing settings may not apply to those purchases
can i turn off voice purchasing
yes, alexa has voice purchasing settings
voice purchasing in your alexa app to turn off voice purchasing from amazon
you can also require an optional confirmation code that alexa will ask you to say out loud when you want to place an order from amazon
what are the return and cancellation policies for products and content i order using alexa
for information on return policies applicable to products purchased on amazon using alexa, see about our returns policies
in addition, non-digital products purchased using alexa are eligible for free returns
to return a product purchased using alexa, process your return as normal in the returns centre
we’ll automatically refund you any delivery charges applied to the return
you should see the delivery refund within 7 days of receiving your product refund
amazon's return policies do not apply to purchases of non-digital products or services made through third-party alexa skills (for instance, a food order placed through a restaurant's skill)
instead, the returns policy of the applicable skill developer applies
however, the amazon pay a-to-z guarantee covers qualified purchases of physical products made through third-party alexa skills using amazon pay
purchases of digital content are final
however, if you accidentally purchase digital content or a subscription to a non-amazon service through alexa, that purchase is eligible for return and refund if we receive your request within 7 days of the date of purchase
to request a refund, please contact customer service
you may cancel the auto-renewal of a subscription to a non-amazon service by visiting the detail page for the applicable alexa skill in your alexa app and adjusting your subscription settings
you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid
for subscriptions to amazon services, see the terms of use for the applicable subscription for information on refund eligibility and cancellation terms
how does alexa work with smart home devices
alexa enables you to control and check the status of a variety of smart home devices, such as lights, electrical sockets, cameras and thermostats
see compatible smart home devices
you can connect compatible smart home devices to alexa using alexa smart home skills
you can also directly connect certain smart home devices to echo devices with a built-in smart home hub like echo plus
we may automatically update the firmware for certain devices on behalf of the applicable manufacturer

you can turn off all kids skills at any time by changing that same setting
when turned off, kids skills cannot be used on your account
you can find more information about each kid skill, including any terms provided by the developer of the skill, on the detail page for the skill in your alexa app
how do voice profiles work
you can create a voice profile, so alexa can call you by name and do more to personalise your experience
when you create a voice profile, alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics
alexa stores these acoustic models in the cloud
if a user stops using alexa and their voice is not recognised for three years, we will automatically delete the acoustic model for their voice
if alexa recognises your voice when you are using a third-party skill, that skill may receive a numeric identifier that allows it to distinguish you from other users in your household to better personalise your experience
you can turn off personalisation of third-party skills based on recognised voices, or delete any voice profile you've created in the alexa app
deleting the voice profile you’ve created will also delete the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice
what is local voice control
local voice control allows alexa to fulfill a limited set of requests on select echo devices when the device is not connected to the internet, such as requests to control supported lights, plugs, and electrical sockets
after your echo device regains its internet connection, the recording of your request is sent to the cloud and available to review in settings
history in the alexa app
you can turn local voice control off by visiting settings

alexa-enabled echo devices faqs
alexa-enabled echo devices, like amazon echo, echo show and echo auto are hands free alexa-enabled devices
for information on echo buds, see the echo buds faqs
for information on echo connect, see the echo connect faqs
how do echo devices recognise the wake word
echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
once the word is detected, audio begins streaming to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
how do i know when echo devices are streaming audio to the cloud
when echo devices detect the wake word, or when the action button available on some echo devices is pressed to activate alexa, a visual indicator appears on the device to indicate that the device is recording your request to stream to the cloud
for instance, a light ring on the amazon echo will turn blue or a blue bar will appear on echo show
when you use the wake word, the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your question or request has been processed
you can turn on follow-up mode to enable alexa to respond to a series of requests without repeating the wake word
you can also configure echo devices to play a short audible tone any time audio is sent to the cloud within settings in the alexa app
certain echo devices, like echo input, have the short audible tone turned on by default
can i turn off the microphones on echo devices
echo devices are equipped with a microphone off button
when the button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated
when the microphones are turned off, your device cannot record and stream audio to the cloud, even when you say your chosen wake word
how do echo devices with a screen know to turn on the screen
echo devices with a screen will turn on the screen when they detect the wake word or motion in view of the camera or when you interact with the device's display or buttons
how do i know when echo devices with a camera are streaming images or video to the cloud
there will be an on-screen indicator whenever echo devices with a camera are streaming images or video to the cloud
for instance, if a video call is active, the device’s screen will display a picture-in-picture view of the video being streamed to the cloud or will display a green "call in progress" bar at the bottom of the screen
can i turn off the camera on echo devices with a camera
you can turn off the camera on echo devices with a camera by pushing the microphone/camera off button on your device
when the microphone/camera off button is pressed, the power to the camera and the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated
some echo devices with a camera, like echo show 5, have an additional built-in camera shutter
when the camera is turned off by pressing the microphone/camera off button or the camera shutter is covering the camera, the device will not detect motion in view of the camera and you will not be able to use any features that rely on the camera such as video calling
echo buds are alexa-enabled wireless earbuds that use the alexa app on your mobile device to access alexa
how do echo buds recognize the wake word
echo buds are designed to detect the wake word "alexa" by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
once the wake word is detected, audio begins streaming to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to amazon’s cloud unless the device detects the wake word
echo buds are designed to optimize for audio input from the person wearing them and detect the wake word only if you have at least one earbud in your ear
you can also use touch controls on your earbuds to invoke alexa or your mobile device’s native voice service (google assistant or siri)
how do i know when echo buds are streaming audio to the cloud
you will hear a short audible tone that plays after the wake word is recognized to indicate that the device is streaming audio to amazon’s cloud
a tone will also play at the end of your request to indicate the connection has closed and the device is no longer streaming audio
the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your request has been processed
can i turn off alexa wake word detection on echo buds
you can turn off alexa wake word detection in the alexa app
in addition, if you remove an earbud from your ear, access to alexa will be disabled for that earbud
you can also mute the device’s microphones in the alexa app or by configuring a custom touch gesture
when you mute the device’s microphones, the microphones will still have power so they can be used for echo buds’ active noise reduction and pass-through features
when an earbud is placed in the echo buds charging case, the microphones on that earbud will turn off
how does the alexa service on echo buds work if my mobile device’s lock screen has been enabled
if your mobile device’s lock screen is on, you can still access many alexa features using the wake word
you’ll be required to unlock your mobile device and open the alexa app to access other alexa features
you will only need to do this once each time you use echo buds, as long as you continue to wear at least one earbud
echo connect is an accessory that transforms any supported echo device into a hands-free speaker phone for your home phone line
what do i need in order to use echo connect
you need a home phone service (such as a landline or voip service), wi-fi, and a supported echo device
one echo connect can support only one phone line, and only one echo connect can be registered per amazon account
how does calling on echo connect work
echo connect extends and is not a replacement for your traditional telephone service
plug echo connect into your home phone jack or voip adapter
you will also need to setup your supported echo device
uk , or register for alexa communication in the alexa app in order to complete set up of your echo connect
with echo connect, you can ask alexa to make calls using your home phone service to your contacts or to other numbers supported by your home phone service provider (e
"alexa, call mom" or "alexa, call 03069990978)
echo connect will display your home phone number as caller id, unless you disable caller id with your home phone service provider
you can also use your supported echo devices to answer incoming calls to your home phone service (e
"alexa, answer the phone")
as echo connect uses your existing home phone service to make and receive calls, home phone service provider charges may apply
some calling features you may use on your home phone (such as call waiting and three-way calling) are not available through echo connect
what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
by default, echo connect will use your home phone service to make and receive your calls
however, you can choose whether you prefer to place outbound calls to most numbers in the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico through either echo connect using your home phone service, or alexa calling
simply go to settings, select echo connect, and select ‘outbound calls’
if you select alexa calling, calls to most mobile and landline numbers in the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico will be placed at no additional cost using the alexa calling service
calls not supported by alexa calling, including 999, 112, 911 and other emergency numbers, premium numbers, and international numbers outside the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico, will automatically be placed through echo connect using your home phone service
the mobile number used to register for alexa communication will be displayed as a caller id for outbound calls made using alexa calling
you can disable the caller id feature through your contact card in the alexa app
alexa calling uses your echo device's internet connection to place calls
for more information on alexa calling, see the above alexa communication faqs
if you select echo connect, your home phone service will be used to place all calls and your home phone number will be displayed as caller id
i have an echo connect but also use alexa calling
how will my call to an alexa contact be processed
if you want to call another alexa communication user, there are a few different ways your call may be processed
if you specify just the name of the person you would like to call (e
"alexa, call mum"), alexa will default to placing the call through alexa calling to mom's supported echo devices or the alexa app
if you specify the name of the person and their phone type (e
"alexa, call mum's mobile"), then, depending on what you have selected as your outbound calling preference, alexa will place the call to mum's mobile using either your home phone service through your echo connect, or alexa calling
for more information, see the above faq "what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
can i call emergency services with echo connect
yes, calling emergency services as 999 or 112 through echo connect works just like dialling any other phone number
simply say, "alexa, call 999”
please note that if echo connect is used to call emergency numbers like 999, the location information given to the emergency service, if any, may be the address associated with the phone line connected to your echo connect, which may not be the same as the location of your echo device from which you are making the call
echo connect will not function in the event of a power or broadband outage or other connectivity issues
if you are unable to place your call through your echo connect, you should use your mobile, landline telephone, or other telephone service

alexa and alexa device faqs
alexa-enabled echo devices faqs
alexa on fire tablets faqs
alexa on fire tv faqs
how do i use alexa
alexa allows you to ask questions and make requests using just your voice
for instance, you can ask alexa a question, such as "what is the weather today in london
", or tell alexa to do something, like "add cat food to my shopping list," or "play jazz
" when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon’s cloud so we can process and respond to your request
you access alexa differently based on the type of device you are using
for “hands free” devices, like amazon echo, you access alexa by saying the wake word (alexa, echo, amazon or computer)
for other devices, like certain fire tablets, you access alexa by pressing a button
is alexa recording all my conversations
by default, echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
what happens when i speak to alexa
when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon’s cloud where we process your request and other information to respond to you
for example, when you ask “alexa, play top hits on amazon music” we use the recording of your request and information from amazon music to play top hits
how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
alexa and echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud
by default, alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
when an alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, alexa performs a "cloud verification" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word
if the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud
if alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream
what about "false wakes"
in some cases, your alexa-enabled device might interpret another word or sound as the wake word (for instance, the name "alex" or someone saying "alexa" on the radio or television)
when this happens, we call that a "false wake
" we have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the faq "how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
anytime your echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your voice history available in the alexa app at settings
alexa privacy or https
can i review and delete my voice recordings
you can review voice recordings associated with your account and delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting privacy in settings in the alexa app or www
from either page, you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically
and you can delete all those voice recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting manage your content and devices
you can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice
once enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by saying "alexa, delete what i just said" or you can delete all the voice recordings from your account for the day by saying "alexa, delete everything i said today
" to enable deletion by voice go to settings
review voice history or https
when enabled, anyone with access to your alexa-enabled devices can ask alexa to delete voice recordings from your account
deleting voice recordings may degrade your alexa experience
if you have changed your default marketplace while using an alexa-enabled product, you will need to perform this step for each marketplace to delete all voice recordings associated with your account
what happens when i delete my voice recordings
when you delete voice recordings associated with your account, we will delete the voice recordings and the text transcripts of your request that you selected from amazon’s cloud
we may still retain other records of your alexa interactions, including records of actions alexa took in response to your request
this allows us, for instance, to continue to provide your reminders, timers, and alarms, process your orders, and show your shopping and to-do lists and messages sent through alexa communications
if your request was processed by an alexa skill, deleting your voice recordings does not delete any information retained by the developer of that skill (skill developers do not receive voice recordings)
for more information on alexa skills, refer to the faq "how do alexa skills work
for more information on removing messages sent through alexa communications, refer to the faq "how do i remove messages from my conversation list
for more information on deleting the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice when you created a voice profile, refer to the faq "how do voice profiles work”
what is alexa's voice history feature
voice history is a feature that allows you to play the audio of your voice recordings that were streamed to the cloud, review the text transcript of what alexa thought you said, and review alexa’s response
this feature can help you better understand how alexa works and what alexa is and is not recording
you can also use it to recall answers alexa gave you previously, such as the name of a restaurant alexa recommended
if alexa makes a mistake, you can use this feature to see what may have gone wrong, such as whether alexa misunderstood a particular word or phrase
you can access alexa’s voice history by visiting settings
review voice history in the alexa app or https
you can also help us improve our voice services by providing feedback within your voice history
how are my voice recordings used
alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience and our services
we associate your requests with your amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other amazon services (e
, so you can ask alexa to read your kindle books and play audiobooks from audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience
for example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps alexa choose what songs to play when you say, "alexa, play music
at times, alexa can provide you with recommendations based on your requests
for example, alexa may recommend alexa skills you might like based on the alexa skills you use
how do my voice recordings improve alexa
alexa is a continuously improving service that is designed to get smarter every day
for example, we use your requests to alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning
training alexa with real world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for alexa to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns, dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where customers use alexa
this training relies in part on supervised machine learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future
for example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the weather in austin can identify that alexa misinterpreted it as a request for the weather in boston
our supervised learning process includes multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy
you can manage the use of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new features by visiting settings
manage how your data improves alexa in the alexa app
how do alexa skills work
skills are voice-driven alexa capabilities
you can view and enable skills in your alexa app and enable certain skills by voice
you can use a skill by saying a specific phrase, called the invocation name
when you use a skill, we may exchange related information with the developer of that skill, such as your answers when you play a trivia skill, your postcode when you ask for the weather, or the content of your requests (but not the voice recordings)
if you make a request to alexa without using a skill invocation name, we may send the content of your request to several skills, and enable and launch the skill we think is best able to respond to your request
the skills portion of your alexa app contains more information about skills, such as applicable privacy policies and terms provided by skill developers
by default, we do not share your personal information with skill developers
you can choose to grant the developer of a skill permission to access additional information associated with your account (such as your name and email address with a restaurant booking skill to make a reservation)
you can see and manage the skills that you granted permission to access specific additional information through settings
alexa privacy or https
how does voice purchasing work
prime members can ask alexa to order or reorder eligible products available for sale through the amazon website
you can also subscribe to eligible services using alexa, or purchase products and services through alexa skills using your default payment and delivery settings
you can require a speakable confirmation code, turn purchasing off, and see product and order details in your alexa app or alexa
uk for those orders
just like orders placed through the amazon website, orders placed through alexa are subject to amazon
uk's conditions of use & sale and, in the case of a subscription for a service, the terms for the applicable service
some alexa skills allow you to purchase non-digital products or services from the developer of the skill (for instance, order food through a restaurant's skill) via amazon pay using your default payment and delivery settings
you can view your amazon pay order history and find additional information for those purchases on the amazon pay website
some other alexa skills allow you to purchase products and services from the developer of the skill using a payment method you provide directly to the developer
your voice purchasing settings may not apply to those purchases
can i turn off voice purchasing
yes, alexa has voice purchasing settings
voice purchasing in your alexa app to turn off voice purchasing from amazon
you can also require an optional confirmation code that alexa will ask you to say out loud when you want to place an order from amazon
what are the return and cancellation policies for products and content i order using alexa
for information on return policies applicable to products purchased on amazon using alexa, see about our returns policies
in addition, non-digital products purchased using alexa are eligible for free returns
to return a product purchased using alexa, process your return as normal in the returns centre
we’ll automatically refund you any delivery charges applied to the return
you should see the delivery refund within 7 days of receiving your product refund
amazon's return policies do not apply to purchases of non-digital products or services made through third-party alexa skills (for instance, a food order placed through a restaurant's skill)
instead, the returns policy of the applicable skill developer applies
however, the amazon pay a-to-z guarantee covers qualified purchases of physical products made through third-party alexa skills using amazon pay
purchases of digital content are final
however, if you accidentally purchase digital content or a subscription to a non-amazon service through alexa, that purchase is eligible for return and refund if we receive your request within 7 days of the date of purchase
to request a refund, please contact customer service
you may cancel the auto-renewal of a subscription to a non-amazon service by visiting the detail page for the applicable alexa skill in your alexa app and adjusting your subscription settings
you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid
for subscriptions to amazon services, see the terms of use for the applicable subscription for information on refund eligibility and cancellation terms
how does alexa work with smart home devices
alexa enables you to control and check the status of a variety of smart home devices, such as lights, electrical sockets, cameras and thermostats
see compatible smart home devices
you can connect compatible smart home devices to alexa using alexa smart home skills
you can also directly connect certain smart home devices to echo devices with a built-in smart home hub like echo plus
we may automatically update the firmware for certain devices on behalf of the applicable manufacturer
we may receive information about third-party smart home devices you connect to alexa, such as device type, name, features, status and usage history
what are kids skills and how do i enable them
kids skills are skills that have been identified by the developer as directed to children
kids skills are turned off by default
you can turn all kids skills on in the settings menu of your alexa app
you can turn off all kids skills at any time by changing that same setting
when turned off, kids skills cannot be used on your account
you can find more information about each kid skill, including any terms provided by the developer of the skill, on the detail page for the skill in your alexa app
how do voice profiles work
you can create a voice profile, so alexa can call you by name and do more to personalise your experience
when you create a voice profile, alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics
alexa stores these acoustic models in the cloud
if a user stops using alexa and their voice is not recognised for three years, we will automatically delete the acoustic model for their voice
if alexa recognises your voice when you are using a third-party skill, that skill may receive a numeric identifier that allows it to distinguish you from other users in your household to better personalise your experience
you can turn off personalisation of third-party skills based on recognised voices, or delete any voice profile you've created in the alexa app
deleting the voice profile you’ve created will also delete the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice
what is local voice control
local voice control allows alexa to fulfill a limited set of requests on select echo devices when the device is not connected to the internet, such as requests to control supported lights, plugs, and electrical sockets
after your echo device regains its internet connection, the recording of your request is sent to the cloud and available to review in settings
history in the alexa app
you can turn local voice control off by visiting settings

can i call or message via alexa using my existing phone service
yes, on certain alexa-enabled products (like echo buds), alexa connects to your phone and allows you to send and receive calls and messages via alexa using your existing phone service and talk/text plan
when you ask alexa to place a call or message, alexa will use alexa communication to complete those requests if possible
however, if the recipient is not another alexa communication user, or you wish to contact a specific phone number, alexa can use your existing phone service to place that call or message (features may vary by device and operating system and charges from your phone service may apply)
alexa may not be able to process your request in the event of network or connectivity issues
if you are unable to place your call via alexa, you should dial the number directly from your phone
can i link third-party communications services with alexa communication
yes, you can link select third-party communications services with alexa communication
simply go to “communications” within settings in the alexa app
amazon may import and save your contacts from your third-party communications service in the cloud to help you connect with your friends and family
some features may not be available via alexa, and charges from the third-party communications service may apply for use of some features
you should check any terms applicable to the third-party communications service (including whether emergency services are available) prior to linking your account with alexa
alexa-enabled echo devices faqs
alexa-enabled echo devices, like amazon echo, echo show and echo auto are hands free alexa-enabled devices
for information on echo buds, see the echo buds faqs
for information on echo connect, see the echo connect faqs
how do echo devices recognise the wake word
echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
once the word is detected, audio begins streaming to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
how do i know when echo devices are streaming audio to the cloud
when echo devices detect the wake word, or when the action button available on some echo devices is pressed to activate alexa, a visual indicator appears on the device to indicate that the device is recording your request to stream to the cloud
for instance, a light ring on the amazon echo will turn blue or a blue bar will appear on echo show
when you use the wake word, the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your question or request has been processed
you can turn on follow-up mode to enable alexa to respond to a series of requests without repeating the wake word
you can also configure echo devices to play a short audible tone any time audio is sent to the cloud within settings in the alexa app
certain echo devices, like echo input, have the short audible tone turned on by default
can i turn off the microphones on echo devices
echo devices are equipped with a microphone off button
when the button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated
when the microphones are turned off, your device cannot record and stream audio to the cloud, even when you say your chosen wake word
how do echo devices with a screen know to turn on the screen
echo devices with a screen will turn on the screen when they detect the wake word or motion in view of the camera or when you interact with the device's display or buttons
how do i know when echo devices with a camera are streaming images or video to the cloud
there will be an on-screen indicator whenever echo devices with a camera are streaming images or video to the cloud
for instance, if a video call is active, the device’s screen will display a picture-in-picture view of the video being streamed to the cloud or will display a green "call in progress" bar at the bottom of the screen
can i turn off the camera on echo devices with a camera
you can turn off the camera on echo devices with a camera by pushing the microphone/camera off button on your device
when the microphone/camera off button is pressed, the power to the camera and the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated
some echo devices with a camera, like echo show 5, have an additional built-in camera shutter
when the camera is turned off by pressing the microphone/camera off button or the camera shutter is covering the camera, the device will not detect motion in view of the camera and you will not be able to use any features that rely on the camera such as video calling
echo buds are alexa-enabled wireless earbuds that use the alexa app on your mobile device to access alexa
how do echo buds recognize the wake word
echo buds are designed to detect the wake word "alexa" by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
once the wake word is detected, audio begins streaming to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to amazon’s cloud unless the device detects the wake word
echo buds are designed to optimize for audio input from the person wearing them and detect the wake word only if you have at least one earbud in your ear
you can also use touch controls on your earbuds to invoke alexa or your mobile device’s native voice service (google assistant or siri)
how do i know when echo buds are streaming audio to the cloud
you will hear a short audible tone that plays after the wake word is recognized to indicate that the device is streaming audio to amazon’s cloud
a tone will also play at the end of your request to indicate the connection has closed and the device is no longer streaming audio
the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your request has been processed
can i turn off alexa wake word detection on echo buds
you can turn off alexa wake word detection in the alexa app
in addition, if you remove an earbud from your ear, access to alexa will be disabled for that earbud
you can also mute the device’s microphones in the alexa app or by configuring a custom touch gesture
when you mute the device’s microphones, the microphones will still have power so they can be used for echo buds’ active noise reduction and pass-through features
when an earbud is placed in the echo buds charging case, the microphones on that earbud will turn off
how does the alexa service on echo buds work if my mobile device’s lock screen has been enabled
if your mobile device’s lock screen is on, you can still access many alexa features using the wake word
you’ll be required to unlock your mobile device and open the alexa app to access other alexa features
you will only need to do this once each time you use echo buds, as long as you continue to wear at least one earbud
echo connect is an accessory that transforms any supported echo device into a hands-free speaker phone for your home phone line
what do i need in order to use echo connect
you need a home phone service (such as a landline or voip service), wi-fi, and a supported echo device
one echo connect can support only one phone line, and only one echo connect can be registered per amazon account
how does calling on echo connect work
echo connect extends and is not a replacement for your traditional telephone service
plug echo connect into your home phone jack or voip adapter
you will also need to setup your supported echo device
uk , or register for alexa communication in the alexa app in order to complete set up of your echo connect
with echo connect, you can ask alexa to make calls using your home phone service to your contacts or to other numbers supported by your home phone service provider (e
"alexa, call mom" or "alexa, call 03069990978)
echo connect will display your home phone number as caller id, unless you disable caller id with your home phone service provider
you can also use your supported echo devices to answer incoming calls to your home phone service (e
"alexa, answer the phone")
as echo connect uses your existing home phone service to make and receive calls, home phone service provider charges may apply
some calling features you may use on your home phone (such as call waiting and three-way calling) are not available through echo connect
what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
by default, echo connect will use your home phone service to make and receive your calls
however, you can choose whether you prefer to place outbound calls to most numbers in the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico through either echo connect using your home phone service, or alexa calling
simply go to settings, select echo connect, and select ‘outbound calls’
if you select alexa calling, calls to most mobile and landline numbers in the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico will be placed at no additional cost using the alexa calling service
calls not supported by alexa calling, including 999, 112, 911 and other emergency numbers, premium numbers, and international numbers outside the united kingdom, united states, canada and mexico, will automatically be placed through echo connect using your home phone service
the mobile number used to register for alexa communication will be displayed as a caller id for outbound calls made using alexa calling
you can disable the caller id feature through your contact card in the alexa app
alexa calling uses your echo device's internet connection to place calls
for more information on alexa calling, see the above alexa communication faqs
if you select echo connect, your home phone service will be used to place all calls and your home phone number will be displayed as caller id
i have an echo connect but also use alexa calling
how will my call to an alexa contact be processed
if you want to call another alexa communication user, there are a few different ways your call may be processed
if you specify just the name of the person you would like to call (e
"alexa, call mum"), alexa will default to placing the call through alexa calling to mom's supported echo devices or the alexa app
if you specify the name of the person and their phone type (e
"alexa, call mum's mobile"), then, depending on what you have selected as your outbound calling preference, alexa will place the call to mum's mobile using either your home phone service through your echo connect, or alexa calling
for more information, see the above faq "what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
can i call emergency services with echo connect
yes, calling emergency services as 999 or 112 through echo connect works just like dialling any other phone number
simply say, "alexa, call 999”
please note that if echo connect is used to call emergency numbers like 999, the location information given to the emergency service, if any, may be the address associated with the phone line connected to your echo connect, which may not be the same as the location of your echo device from which you are making the call
echo connect will not function in the event of a power or broadband outage or other connectivity issues
if you are unable to place your call through your echo connect, you should use your mobile, landline telephone, or other telephone service
