the canadian real estate association (“crea”) is committed to clearly explaining to you what it does with your personal information
on this webpage you’ll find information about the types of personal information we gather, how we use it, and whether we provide some of that information to anyone else
for starters, you’ll see that we refer to “privacy policy” and “privacy policies” throughout this webpage
the simplest way to wrap your head around this is to think of crea’s “privacy policy” as the combined total of all of crea’s “privacy policies”, which are specific portions of our overall policy
when we say “personal information” what we mean is any information about an identifiable individual not including
the name, title, business email, business address or telephone number of an individual when collected, used and disclosed solely for the purpose of communicating or facilitating communication with the individual in relation to their employment, business or profession
aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual
it’s also important to note that crea interacts with people falling into several different categories
individuals using the website or mobile application versions of realtor
ca in order to find out information on properties they are interested in
individuals browsing one of our other websites like our corporate website, crea
our members, realtors®, who have access to a suite of membership services
global affiliates , real estate professionals in foreign jurisdictions who have contracted with crea in order to get access to a suite of affiliate services
buyers and sellers, who may have provided listing information to their realtor® and now see that their property is advertised on realtor
the personal information we may gather about realtors® is very different than the personal information about realtor
for this reason, we’ve broken down crea’s privacy policy into discrete chunks organized under four key headings
realtors ® and global affiliates
crea also has some general privacy policies that always apply regardless of who you are, what crea product you are using, or how you otherwise interact with us
to find out more visit our general privacy policies
if you have any questions or concerns regarding any aspect of this privacy policy, please direct them to
the chief privacy officer (cpo), the canadian real estate association 200 catherine street, 6th floor ottawa, on k2p 2k9 phone
this portion of our privacy policy applies to the realtor
ca website and mobile applications that are branded as realtor
ca - crea’s real estate advertising online product
for the most part, all versions of realtor
ca, regardless of the platform, collect, use and disclose your personal information in the same way
for this reason we collectively refer to them as “realtor
ca use your information
in addition to the uses described in crea’s privacy policies applicable to all crea sites , personal information collected by realtor
ca may be used by crea for the following general purposes
for registration and to manage your realtor

ca use your information ”
you may delete your account at any time
if you delete your realtor
ca account, your personal information will be anonymized after 30-days (in case you accidentally deleted your account and wish to contact us to reactivate it)
notwithstanding your account anonymization, crea may retain a record of when you subscribed to any of our email lists to help us demonstrate we are compliant with canada’s anti-spam legislation
crea may also retain other account information (e
a record of when you agreed to the realtor
ca terms of use) for evidentiary/litigation purposes or where crea is required to keep such information by law
throughout your use of the real estate services on this website, you may communicate extensively with a salesperson or broker
the salesperson or broker may use your email address, telephone number, and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate
crea collects the emails provided through the "contact us" feature of this website, so crea can respond to your questions or suggestions
crea also collects e-mails sent through the website, including the “email realtor®, “email a friend”, and “email office" features, for security purposes, to allow the recipient brokers and salespersons to view your email, to send you communications you have opted-in to receive, and for management of your website account

privacy policies applicable to all crea sites
this portion of our privacy policy describes some basic functionality how all our websites and mobile applications use your personal information (including but not limited to realtor
we’ve broken it down into four topics
general website uses of your personal information
crea may use the personal information you provide to us via our websites for the following general purposes
to send you communications you have opted-in to receive
to respond to your questions and comments
to tailor your experience of the crea website you are using
to help crea analyze the browsing patterns of its users in order to improve the content and design of its websites
for security purposes, such as the prevention, investigation or disruption of potentially prohibited (e
spam) or illegal activities
to register for crea events accessible through the crea website and to facilitate your attendance at such events, including but not limited to
to understand who is attending the event
to meet your needs at the event
to verify your identity
to manage any accounts you hold with us
to send you announcements, notification or message about the event
to better understand how you engaged with the event
to enforce the website terms of use
as otherwise described to you when the information is collected
your personal information may be anonymized and consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with third parties, including research firms and crea member boards and associations
the shared data will not disclose your personal information and will not enable the recipients to contact you
our websites use standard technology known as “cookies”, which are text files that are used to store certain information in your browser
we use “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies
session cookies temporarily keep your settings
this information is stored until your internet browser is closed
persistent cookies store information on your computer even after your internet browser is closed and are stored locally on your system
you may choose to delete persistent cookies after visiting our websites via your internet browser’s privacy settings
crea may use session and persistent cookies for the following purposes
to prepopulate website fields with information you entered earlier (for example, pre-populating fields on realtor
remembering what a user did previously
to keep track of a user’s actions (for example, recently viewed properties on realtor
to keep a record of whether a user has agreed to our website terms of use
security and protection of realtor
cookies are used to reduce the likelihood that someone is able to scrape our websites
cookies are used to direct browsers to communicate with specific realtor
ca servers that they have previously accessed to increase the performance with that server
when new features are announced on our websites a splash page may be shown announcing that features
users who indicate they not wish to see the splash page again will have their preference stored in a cookie
cookies allow us to know a bit about crea website users, for example, which third-party website they have just visited, so that we can display personalized content
statistical analysis (for example, to track the usage of website features)
to permit specific third-party functionality
crea has partnered with several third parties that install cookies on user computers when using our websites
these cookies help us improve the functionality of our websites (for example, cookies are used to support a program by foresee, which invites realtor
ca users to complete a survey and keeps track of whether they have been invited to complete the survey already and what realtor
ca website pages they have seen) or help us determine how our websites are being used (for example, google analytics, which uses cookies, is used on realtor
crea works with advertising networks and publishers to serve personalized display ads for crea products and services on third-party websites
third parties may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information (e
, click stream information, browser type, time and date) about users’ interactions with products and services on crea
ca to help determine which ads are likely to be most interesting to you
this information also helps crea monitor and improve our products and services
learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out
crea’s mobile applications may also collect and use similar information to serve personalized display ads within those apps
these ads are personalized based on your use of apps, as well as online activities on your mobile device and other devices (sometimes referred to as “cross-device personalization”)
mobile application technology works a bit differently than browser technology so follow the following instructions if you wish to opt out
apple (ios) - on your iphone or ipad, go to settings
advertising and turn on limit ad track to opt-out of interest-based ads from “iad”, apple’s advertising network
android - open the google settings app on your android phone, tap ads and enable “opt out of interest-based ads”
crea also uses social media matching tools, such as facebook custom audiences and google customer match
this allows us to deliver personalized ads to crea members or users of our websites/apps who are also users of these sites/apps
this requires crea to provide a minimal amount of information (e
, name and email address) to these sites so they can determine which members/users also belong to those sites
this information is “hashed” before it is disclosed, is deleted once the matching process is complete, and is not used for any other purpose by social media sites or any other third-party
you can opt-out of this process by
clicking on the icon on the top right corner of the ads from crea that you see on facebook
to learn more about advertising on facebook generally and how to control your preferences, visit www
com and ensure that the “ads based on your interests” setting is turned off
we may use non-identifiable information to personalize the content you see on a crea website based on a site you have previously visited
for example, if you click on a hyperlink on a third party website that brings you to a crea website, the banking website may place a cookie in your browser that contains a numerical code, and based on that code, the crea website might display a widget
the cookie will persist for 30 days, so if you clear your cookies, the content will no longer be personalized
other technical stuff relating to crea websites
you have to be a bit of a tech geek to understand topics falling under this heading (p
we love tech geeks
ip addresses crea websites collect information about how our websites are used
each time a visitor comes to one of our websites our web server collects the visitor's domain name or ip address
crea cannot determine an individual’s identity from only an ip address
however, periodically users may inform crea support staff of their ip addresses during the provision of support services
users that submit their name when using the email functionality on our websites will also have their names associated with their ip addresses
at such time, crea treats such information as personal information
messages and emails many crea websites have “contact us” or similarly named functionality that allows you to contact us
it is probably obvious but crea collects the e-mails provided through this functionality, so crea can respond to your questions or suggestions
less obvious is the fact that we may use this information for security purposes, such as screening the emails for spam
surveys while visiting our websites you may be asked to participate in a survey conducted by a third party
if you are selected to participate in this survey, a persistent cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive for 60 days to preclude a new invitation during that time
all surveys are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any personal information
survey data is used to permit accurate analysis, produce summary reports, and monitor overall trends with our websites
google analytics many crea websites use google analytics, a web and mobile analytics tracking tool provided by google, for audience activity, demographics reporting, and remarketing
you can opt-out of google analytics by installing a browser plug-in available on google’s website
as google analytics also uses cookies, you may wish to review that section of our privacy policy as well

potential risks when providing personal information to crea
we have an obligation to tell you if there are any risks to you that could result if someone (not us
) misuses the personal information you provide us
honestly, we’ve struggled what to say here as most of the information we collect is not particularly sensitive
one thing we wanted to flag, however, is that whenever you share your email with another person using our websites, there is a risk that other person could misuse that email
we’ve taken legal (e
terms of use), technological (e
anti-spam filters and captcha technology) and design (e
designing our systems to reduce the likelihood of your email being misused) measures to try to limit such abuse, but no system is perfect
please feel free to report any potential abuse to us
also, keep in mind that when you provide your personal information to a realtor® (for example to, advertise your listing), the realtor® may use a variety of crea, board/association and third party systems and software solutions to promote that property and conduct the transaction
so your personal information may end up in more places than you originally anticipated
talk to your realtor® to find out just what exactly they do with your personal information, so you aren’t surprised
