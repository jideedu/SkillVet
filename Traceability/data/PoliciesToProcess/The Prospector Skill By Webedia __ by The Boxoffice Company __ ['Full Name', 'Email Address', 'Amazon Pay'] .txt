these third party applications may appear to be part of our site or other service, but the content is provided by a third party server

please review this policy and the terms of use for this site and/or service carefully
your use of this site and/or service signifies your agreement to such policy and terms of use
1) what types of information prospector collects a) our goal is to collect and use only that information that we think is required for our legitimate non-profit interests, in order to better understand your interests and to improve your experience of using our site or other service
in order to do so, we collect the following types of information
i) personally identifiable information personally identifiable information is any information that identifies a living individual, such as your first and last name, mailing address, phone number, mobile phone number email address, photograph, credit/debit card number and expiration date (or other payment-method information), login id, member name and password and other information about a specific individual that identifies the individual ("personally identifiable information")
when you sign up for or use the site or other service, prospector collects some amount of personally identifiable information from you
prospector also collects personally identifiable information that you may voluntarily provide when you use the site or other service, that you may disclose in a public area of the site or other service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room), or that you may include if you communicate with prospector, such as by responding to polls or survey, registering for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities, or submitting requests to our prospector team
in some instances, when you use certain features of the site or other service, prospector may collect the email addresses or other personally identifiable information of others that you may provide
unless stated otherwise at the point of collection, we will treat any such personally identifiable information that you submit about other people in accordance with this policy
ii) non-personally identifiable information prospector collects information from you automatically when you use the site or other service
non-personally identifiable information is information that does not specifically identify a living individual and is not used with personally identifiable information to determine an individual's identity, including a computer's internet protocol ("ip") address, a mobile device's unique identifier, computer and device connection information such as browser type or version, demographic information, such as a person's age, zip code and other data collected automatically through the operation of this site or other service ("non-personally identifiable information")
we may collect site usage data and other non-personally identifiable information (such as which site pages are visited and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies
for example, our web servers automatically collect ip addresses from computers and other devices that visit the site
an ip address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer by the internet service provider whenever the computer is connected to the internet
web servers, the computers that "serve up" and deliver web pages, automatically identify a computer by its ip address, and when a page is requested from a website, its servers log the ip address of the computer requesting the page
when we are collecting information regarding what pages and content on this site or other service a computer is accessing and using, in general we do not link that computer's ip addresses to any personally identifiable information, so although the site usage data associated with a computer's ip address will be logged, your identity will remain anonymous to us and the site
for portions of the site or other service that may require registration or a log-in, we may also collect your registration, username and password information from you when you register or log in to those portions of the site or other service
during some visits, we and/or third party providers may use software tools, such as javascript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page
b) how prospector collects information i) cookies like many sites, we and third parties that provide content on and through the site or other service use "cookies" or other similar technologies to collect information
a cookie is a small text file that is sent to your computer from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive when you visit a website
prospector's cookies contain personally identifiable information, such as your login id and your email address, as well as non- personally identifiable information
prospector uses cookies to allow you to log in automatically and to ensure that you have agreed to the terms, conditions and policies that govern your use of the site or other service
in addition, prospector uses cookies to measure traffic activity on the site, track your use of the site or other service, and provide you with a more personalized user experience by allowing prospector to provide targeted advertising and determine which areas of the site or other service may be the most popular or useful to you
similarly, if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products and promotions, by using cookies we collect information about which site pages you have visited and in what order that may allow us to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences
most browsers are initially set to accept cookies
if you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the site or other service may not function properly if you do so

ii) ip address an ip address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the internet
prospector logs your ip address and uses your ip address to track your usage of the site or other service

prospector also uses your personally identifiable information to provide you with information that you request, and deliver content to you that is relevant to your interests
if you use prospector to give a gift, prospector may use the email addresses you provide to send your gifts, and other communications relating to such transaction, and any further communications as may be authorized by the recipient
we also may send information or offers to selected groups of site or service users on behalf of other businesses
when we do this, we do not give those businesses your name or address
under certain circumstances (for example, if you win a contest) we may post your personally identifiable information on this site
we will notify you of this possibility when you provide the personally identifiable information and if possible, when the personally identifiable information is posted
cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the site or other service and non-personally identifiable information to personally identifiable information obtained from you
if any non-personally identifiable information is linked with personally identifiable information, the linked non-personally identifiable information will then be treated as personally identifiable information
b) anti-spam policy i) prospector is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam")

for third-party sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we may request personally identifiable information from you that may be shared with the sponsor upon request
if prospector sells all or part of the site and/or other service or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your personally identifiable information to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction
upon such transfer, the privacy policies of the acquiring entity may govern the further collection and use of your personally identifiable information

prospector does not control the privacy policies of such third parties, and their privacy policies will govern their use of your information once it has been transmitted by prospector
