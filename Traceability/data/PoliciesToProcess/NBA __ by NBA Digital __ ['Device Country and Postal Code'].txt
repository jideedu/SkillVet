if you connect your use of the services through a third party service (e
, a social media platform), the third party may share certain information from your third party account with us
other third party data , such as data from our affiliates, partners or vendors, data brokers or public sources

we use the data we collect to operate our business, including providing and improving the services
to fulfill transactions that you request
to deliver location-based services and comply with territorial restrictions
to diagnose and fix problems with the services and providing other customer support services
for analytical purposes to better understand our fans and how they use the services, which allows us to continually improve and expand the services
to build predictive models, which allow us to tailor the services based on the data we have about how our fans use the services
we use the data we collect to communicate with you, including responding to your requests or inquiries
to respond to your request if you contact us with a question or concern
to provide information about your account, your use of the services or other transactions that you request

to send you promotional messages and deliver advertisements about products, services, programs or events that may be of interest to you
these may be offered by, or on behalf of, the nba family, or by our partners and other third parties with whom we have a relationship
the promotional messages and advertisements that you see may be determined by data that we collect or receive about you, such as your demographic data, location data, usage data, interests and preferences
we refer to this as “interest-based advertising”
security, compliance and enforcement
we use the data we collect for security, compliance and enforcement purposes
to protect the safety and security of our fans and our services
to detect and prevent abuse, fraud or other unlawful or unauthorized activities
to enforce our agreements, including our policies and terms of service that govern your use of the services
we may also use your data in any other manner as disclosed at the time of collection, or when we have otherwise obtained consent
please also note that this policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymized data
how we share and disclose data there are times when the data we collect may be shared by the nba family
we share your data for the following purposes
we sometimes engage or partner with other companies to operate the services or perform certain functions on our behalf – for example, maintaining our fan database, delivering messages and advertising, operating our websites and digital platforms
we may provide these companies with access to your data as needed for them to perform these functions in a manner consistent with this policy
among the nba family
we share personal data among the companies within the nba family for purposes consistent with this policy
as part of a change in business structure
in the event of a sale, merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar event, or in contemplation of such an event (e
, due diligence), your data may be among the transferred assets
when necessary under certain circumstances
we may disclose your personal data when we believe that disclosure is necessary to
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process
protect the safety and security of our fans or our services
prevent fraud, abuse or other unlawful or unauthorized activities
protect the rights or property of us or third parties, including enforcing the terms of our agreements
we may also share your data for any other purpose as disclosed at the time of collection, or when we have otherwise obtained consent

what choices you have you have many choices about how we collect, use and share your data
you can choose whether you wish to receive promotional messages from the nba and which types of messages you wish to receive
if you receive promotional messages from us and would like to opt out, you may do so by following instructions within those messages
you may also adjust your communications preferences by logging into your nba account and viewing your preferences
please note that these preferences do not apply to informational or transactional communications regarding the services or other communications that have their own unsubscribe method
you can opt out of interest-based advertising as described in this section and in the “ cookies and similar technologies ” section of this policy
when you opt out, your selection is stored on a cookie on your device
if you delete the cookie from that device or sign in from a different device, you will need to opt out again
because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing the services and for authentication and security purposes), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop the data from being collected nor reduce the number of advertisements you will see
however, the data will not be used for interest-based advertising, which means the advertisements you do see may be less relevant to you
when using a mobile application, you may receive interest-based in-application advertisements
depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your device
in addition, each operating system (e
, ios for apple devices, android for android devices and windows for microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of interest-based in-application advertisements
you may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating system in order to opt-out of interest-based in-application advertisements
for any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator
you also have choices about the data you provide directly to us when you register for or use the services
please note, however, that if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide certain features of the services, your use of the services may not include those features
you can access, edit or remove information in your user account by visiting https
if you cannot access your account, or if you would like to request that we delete other personal data referenced in this policy, you may also contact us using any of the methods described in the “ how to contact us ” section of this policy
you can choose not to share certain location data by adjusting the settings on your device
please note, however, that if you choose not to share this data, you may not be able to access or use location-based services

, social media platforms) share with us using the options provided to you by the applicable third party service (for example, the options provided by a third party social media platform when you connect your social media account with the services)
you can also disconnect your use of the services from the third party service at any time using the options provided to you by the applicable third party service
please note, however, that if you disconnect from the third party service, that will not delete the data we may have previously collected while you were connected
cookies and similar technologies we use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”) to provide the services and to collect data
in addition, third parties may also use tracking technologies when you use the services
for example, if we engaged a third party to operate the services, or because the services contain content or advertisements delivered by third parties
these tracking technologies consist of
cookies are small text files that are unique to your device or browser
they can either be session-based (i
, lasting only while your browser is open and automatically deleted when you close your browser) or persistent (i
, lasting until you delete them or they expire)
locally stored objects (“lsos”), also commonly called “flash cookies,” are stored on your device or browser to provide services that use adobe flash technology
“web beacons” or clear gifs are small pieces of code placed on a service to collect data about users of that service
mobile software development kits (“sdks”) are bits of computer code used by mobile app developers to enable or enhance various features of a mobile app
for example, an app developer may include an sdk within a mobile app that enables advertisements to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed in connection with the mobile app
we use tracking technologies for the following purposes
when you sign into your account to use the services, we use tracking technologies to store your sign-in information
this allows the services to remember your user preferences and give you a more tailored experience based on those preferences
it also allows you to use the services without having to sign-in on each page or each time you return
we use tracking technologies to help detect fraud and abuse of the services, including attempts to access the services without authorization
we use tracking technologies to gather usage and performance data about the services, including counting the number of unique visitors to a particular service
we use tracking technologies to track how many users have seen or clicked on an advertisement
this allows us to learn which advertising campaigns are most effective and also to help limit the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement
we use tracking technologies to collect information about your interests so that we can deliver advertising that is most relevant to your interests
we use tracking technologies to collect information about how you use the services so that we can tailor your experience based on what is most relevant to your interests
in some cases, we may work with third parties (for example, third party operators of the services) to synchronize our unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with tracking technologies) with the third party’s own identifiers
this enables us to better achieve each of the purposes described above
most web browsers give you the ability to manage tracking technologies used on a website, including blocking or deleting them
please note that if you choose to block tracking technologies, you may not be able to use certain features that depend on those tracking technologies (such as keeping you signed in or remembering your preferences)
if you choose to delete tracking technologies, any settings and preferences that were associated with those tracking technologies will also be deleted and may need to be reset
you also have the following options to manage tracking technologies and opt out of interest-based advertising
for flash cookies, you can access flash management tools from adobe’s website
in addition, some, but not all, browsers provide the ability to remove lsos within cookie and privacy settings
you may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on websites by visiting our ad choices page
you may opt out of interest-based advertising from companies that participate in the digital advertising alliance (“daa”) by visiting their website
you may opt out of interest-based advertising from companies that participate in the network advertising initiative by visiting their website
finally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising by adjusting your device or browser settings
please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will stop seeing, or see fewer, advertisements
it does, however, mean that the advertisements you do see will not be interest-based and may be less relevant to your interests
some browsers have incorporated “do not track” features that send an automated signal to the websites that you visit using that browser
at this time, the services do not recognize or respond to these signals
however, you can adjust your preferences regarding the data we collect using the tools and methods described above
security of data the nba family takes security seriously
we take a number of steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure
these steps take into account the sensitivity of the data we collect and use, as well as the current state of technology
this includes, for example, storing your data on systems that have limited access and are maintained in controlled facilities
we also use, and require our vendors to use, industry standard security protocols when processing any payments for your use of the services
it is important to remember that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure
we recommend that you help us keep your data safe by taking reasonable steps such as keeping your passwords private and not disclosing sensitive personal data in places that can be accessed publicly
