if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us using the contact details at the end of this privacy notice
we may not have to comply with your request but we would explain why if we believe we are entitled to refuse
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request")
this enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you
this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us
request erasure of your personal information
this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it
you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law
note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request
object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms
you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes
in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms
request restriction of processing of your personal information
this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios
(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party
where our systems allow, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format
note that this right only applies to information which is processed by automated means
we do not currently hold personal information in a form that is readily portable and it is unlikely we would be able (or required) to comply with such a request
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information
however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent
if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you
we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent
no fee usually required
you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights)
however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive
alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances
what we may need from you
we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights)
this is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it
we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response
time limit to respond
we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month
occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests
in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated
