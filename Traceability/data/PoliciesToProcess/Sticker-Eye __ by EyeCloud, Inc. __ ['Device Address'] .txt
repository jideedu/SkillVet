how do i use alexa
alexa allows you to ask questions and make requests using just your voice
for instance, you can ask alexa a question, such as "what is the weather today in new york
", or tell alexa to do something, like "add batteries to my shopping list," or "play jazz
" when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon's cloud so we can process and respond to your request
you access alexa differently based on the type of device you are using
for "hands free" devices, like the amazon echo, you access alexa by saying the wake word (alexa, echo, amazon, or computer)
for other devices, like certain fire tablets, you access alexa by pressing a button
is alexa recording all my conversations
by default, echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
you can also configure supported echo devices to detect specific sounds, such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass breaking
see the faq "how does alexa guard work
" for more information
what happens when i speak to alexa
when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked alexa is sent to amazon’s cloud where we process your request and other information to respond to you
for example, when you ask “alexa, play top hits on amazon music” we use the recording of your request and information from amazon music to play top hits
how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
alexa and echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud
by default, alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
when an alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, alexa performs a "cloud verification" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word
if the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud
if alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream
what about "false wakes"
in some cases, your alexa-enabled device might interpret another word or sound as the wake word (for instance, the name "alex" or someone saying "alexa" on the radio or television)
when this happens, we call that a "false wake
" we have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the faq "how does alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud
anytime your echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your voice history available in the alexa app at settings
alexa privacy or https
can i review and delete my voice recordings
you can review voice recordings associated with your account and delete the voice recordings one by one, by date range, by alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting settings
alexa privacy in the alexa app or https
from either page, you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice recordings
if you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently in your voice history as well
and you can delete all those voice recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting
manage your content and devices
you can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice
once enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by saying “alexa, delete what i just said,” or delete the voice recordings from your account for the day by saying "alexa, delete everything i said today
" to enable deletion by voice go to settings
manage your alexa data in the alexa app or https
when enabled, anyone with access to your alexa-enabled devices can ask alexa to delete voice recordings from your account
deleting voice recordings may degrade your alexa experience
if you choose not to save any voice recordings, automatic voice recognition and voice profiles may not work
if you have changed your default marketplace while using an alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings associated with your account separately for each marketplace
to learn how to transfer your amazon account to another marketplace, go here
what happens when i delete my voice recordings
when you delete voice recordings associated with your account from voice history, we will delete the voice recordings that you selected and the text transcripts of those recordings from amazon’s cloud
if you choose not to have any voice recordings saved, the text transcripts of your requests will be retained for 30 days, after which they will be automatically deleted
we retain those text transcripts to allow you to review the requests you make to alexa in your voice history, and to improve your alexa experience and our services
you can delete the text transcripts at any time in the alexa app by going to settings
we may still retain other records of your alexa interactions, including records of actions alexa took in response to your request
this allows us, for instance, to continue to provide your reminders, timers, and alarms, process your orders, and show your shopping and to-do lists and messages sent through alexa communications
if your request was processed by an alexa skill, deleting your voice recordings does not delete any information retained by the developer of that skill (skill developers do not receive voice recordings)
for more information on alexa skills, refer to the faq "how do alexa skills work
for more information on removing messages sent through alexa communications, refer to the faq "how do i remove messages from my conversation list
" for more information on deleting the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice when you created a voice profile, refer to the faq "how does automatic voice recognition and voice profiles work
what is alexa's voice history feature
voice history is a feature that allows you to play the audio of your voice recordings that were streamed to the cloud, review the text transcript of what alexa thought you said, and review alexa’s response
this feature can help you better understand how alexa works and what alexa is and is not recording
you can also use it to recall answers alexa gave you previously, such as the name of a restaurant alexa recommended
if alexa makes a mistake, you can use this feature to see what may have gone wrong, such as whether alexa misunderstood a particular word or phrase
you can access alexa’s voice history by visiting settings
review voice history in the alexa app or https
you can also help us improve our voice services by providing feedback within your voice history
how are my voice recordings used
alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience and our services
we associate your requests with your amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other amazon services (e
so you can ask alexa to read your kindle books and play audiobooks from audible ) , and to provide you with a more personalized experience
for example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps alexa choose what songs to play when you say, "alexa, play music
" at times, alexa can provide you with recommendations based on your requests
for example, alexa may recommend alexa skills you might like based on the alexa skills you use
how do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve alexa
alexa is designed to get smarter every day
for example, we use your requests to alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning
training alexa with real world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for alexa to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns, dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where customers use alexa
this training relies in part on supervised machine learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future
for example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the weather in austin can identify that alexa misinterpreted it as a request for the weather in boston
our supervised learning process includes multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy
you can manage the use of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new features by visiting settings
manage your alexa data in the alexa app
how do alexa skills work
skills are voice-driven alexa capabilities
you can view and enable skills in your alexa app and enable certain skills by voice
you can use a skill by saying a specific phrase, called the invocation name
when you use a skill, we may exchange related information with the developer of that skill, such as your answers when you play a trivia skill, your zip code when you ask for the weather, or the content of your requests (but not your voice recordings)
if you make a request to alexa without using a skill invocation name, we may send the content of your request to several skills, and enable and launch the skill we think is best able to respond to your request
the skills portion of your alexa app contains more information about skills, such as privacy policies and terms provided by skill developers
by default, we do not share your personal information with skill developers
you can choose to grant us permission to share additional information with a skill developer (such as your name and email address with a restaurant booking skill to make a reservation)
you can see and manage the skills that you granted permission to access specific additional information through settings

how does automatic voice recognition and voice profiles work
alexa can automatically recognize the voices of users in your household over time to improve personalization of certain alexa features
you can also create a voice profile, so alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience
when alexa recognizes your voice automatically, or when you create a voice profile, alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics
alexa stores these acoustic models in the cloud
if a user stops using alexa and their voice is not recognized for three years, we will automatically delete the acoustic model for their voice
if alexa recognizes your voice when you are using a third-party skill, that skill may receive a numeric identifier that allows it to distinguish you from other users in your household to better personalize your experience
you can turn off automatic voice recognition, turn off personalization of third-party skills based on recognized voices, or delete any voice profile you've created in the alexa app
deleting the voice profile you’ve created will also delete the voice recordings you said to teach alexa your voice
automatic voice recognition is not available in certain locations

if a contact with the alexa app or an echo device with a screen drops in on your echo device with a screen, they will see a frosted glass view from your device's camera
the frosted glass view will automatically transition to clear video over a short period of time
you will see the contact's video (and a picture-in-picture view of your own video) when the drop in is in progress
you can end a drop in by tapping the end icon on the screen, or you can disable the camera while continuing an audio conversation by saying "alexa, video off," or tapping the video off icon on the screen
what is a recently active indicator
if household members or contacts have been granted drop in permission, they will see a recently active indicator on their echo show, echo spot, or alexa app displaying whether someone is nearby your supported echo devices
interactions with alexa, and motion sensors on echo show, will be used to determine whether your device has been recently active
how do i disable drop in
if you have granted your household members drop in permission, you can disable it by saying "alexa, disable drop in," or turning off drop in on your own contact card
if you have granted any other contacts drop in permission, you can disable that on their contact cards
you also may disable drop in for a specific device via the devices icon
communications in the alexa app
what are enhanced features
you can enable enhanced alexa communication features, such as group drop in, via settings
enhanced features in the alexa app
when enabled, your audio and video calls will be decrypted, processed, and then re-encrypted in the cloud in order to provide these features
amazon does not store your audio and video calls
when disabled, you and the other participants on your calls will not be able to use these enhanced features
does alexa communication use encryption
by default, audio and video calls or drop ins between alexa devices or the alexa app are encrypted end-to-end
you can enable enhanced alexa communication features, such as group drop in, in which case your audio and video calls will be temporarily decrypted, processed, and then re-encrypted in the cloud
amazon does not store your audio and video calls, or information about the content of those calls
as with other communications services, if you use alexa to make a call to a landline or mobile phone, the part of that call that takes place over the telephone network is not encrypted
the announcements feature lets you easily make announcements to other supported alexa-enabled devices within your household, like a one-way intercom
simply say, "alexa, announce that dinner's ready," and "dinner's ready," will then be announced in your voice to all supported devices in your household
you can block announcements on one, or all, supported devices by turning on do not disturb - simply say "alexa, turn on do not disturb
unlike drop in, announcements are one-way only
to respond to an announcement, you can make a new announcement or start a drop in as a two-way intercom
can i call or message via alexa using my existing phone service
yes, on certain alexa-enabled products (like echo auto), alexa connects to your phone and allows you to send and receive calls and messages via alexa using your existing phone service and talk/text plan
when you ask alexa to place a call or message, alexa will use alexa communication to complete those requests if possible
however, if the recipient is not another alexa communication user, or you wish to contact a specific phone number, alexa can use your existing phone service to place that call or message (features may vary by device and operating system)
alexa may not be able to process your request in the event of network or connectivity issues
if you are unable to place your call via alexa, you should dial the number directly from your phone
can i link third-party communications services with alexa communication
yes, you can link select third-party communications services with alexa communication
simply go to “communications” within settings in the alexa app
amazon may import and save your contacts from your third-party communications service in the cloud to help you connect with your friends and family
some features may not be available via alexa, and charges from the third-party communications service may apply for use of some features
you should check any terms applicable to the third-party communications service (including whether emergency services are available) prior to linking your account with alexa

how do echo devices recognize the wake word
by default, echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer, or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
once the wake word is detected, the device begins recording audio to send to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
how do i know when echo devices are sending audio to the cloud
when echo devices detect the wake word or when the action button available on some echo devices is pressed to activate alexa, a visual indicator appears on the device to indicate that the device is recording your request to stream to the cloud
for instance, a light ring on the echo will turn blue or a blue bar will appear on echo show
when you use the wake word, the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your request has been processed
you can turn on follow-up mode to enable alexa to respond to a series of requests without repeating the wake word
you can also configure echo devices to play a short audible tone any time audio is sent to the cloud within settings in the alexa app
certain echo devices, like echo input, have the short audible tone turned on by default
can i turn off the microphones on echo devices

when the microphones are off, the status light on the front frame will flash red and the indicator light under the right temple will turn red
when the microphones are turned off, your frames cannot record and stream audio to the amazon cloud, even when you say the wake word or use the controls on the frames to invoke alexa or your mobile device’s native voice service
how does the alexa service on echo frames work when my mobile device is locked

amazon echo look is a hands-free camera and style assistant that is being phased out in 2020
see the amazon echo look faqs here
echo connect is an accessory that transforms any supported echo device into a hands-free speaker phone for your home phone line
what do i need in order to use echo connect
you need a home phone service (such as a landline or voip service), wi-fi, and a supported echo device
one echo connect can support only one phone line, and only one echo connect can be registered per amazon account
how does calling on echo connect work
echo connect extends and is not a replacement for your traditional telephone service
plug echo connect into your home phone jack or voip adapter
you will also need to setup your supported echo device
com , or register for alexa communication in the alexa app in order to complete set up of your echo connect
with echo connect, you can ask alexa to make calls using your home phone service to your contacts or to other numbers supported by your home phone service provider (e
"alexa, call mom," or "alexa, call 844-582-5392
" ) echo connect will display your home phone number as caller id, unless you disable caller id with your home phone service provider
you can also use your supported echo devices to answer incoming calls to your home phone service (e
"alexa, answer the phone
") as echo connect uses your existing home phone service to make and receive calls, home phone service provider charges may apply
some calling features you may use on your home phone (such as call waiting and three-way calling) are not available through echo connect
what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
by default, echo connect will use your home phone service to make and receive your calls
however, you can choose whether you prefer to place outbound calls to most numbers in the us, canada, mexico, and the uk through either echo connect using your home phone service, or alexa calling
simply go to settings, select echo connect, and select "outbound calls"
if you select alexa calling, calls to most mobile and landline numbers in the us, canada, mexico, and the uk will be placed for free using the alexa calling service
calls not supported by alexa calling, including 911 and emergency numbers, premium numbers, and international numbers outside the us, canada, mexico, and the uk will automatically be placed through echo connect using your home phone service
the mobile number used to register for alexa communication will be displayed as a caller id for outbound calls made using alexa calling
you can disable the caller id feature through your contact card in the alexa app
alexa calling uses your echo device's internet connection to place calls
for more information on alexa calling, see the above alexa communication faqs
if you select echo connect, your home phone service will be used to place all calls and your home phone number will be displayed as caller id
by default, alexa will dial all us numbers with a 1 and an area code (e
, 1-844-582-5392) to ensure calls connect
this dialing format may result in some home phone service providers charging long distance call rates for local calls
to instead not add a 1 prior to the area code, go to settings, select echo connect, and toggle "dial 1 for local calls
' if you aren't sure which dialing format applies to you, you should check with your home phone service provider, or select "alexa calling" to make calls to us numbers
i have an echo connect but also use alexa calling
how will my call to an alexa contact be processed
if you want to call another alexa communication user, there are a few different ways your call may be processed
if you specify just the name of the person you would like to call (e
, "alexa, call mom
"), alexa will default to placing the call through alexa calling to mom's supported echo devices or the alexa app
if you specify the name of the person and their phone type (e
, "alexa, call mom's mobile
") then, depending on what you have selected as your outbound calling preference, alexa will place the call to mom's mobile using either your home phone service through your echo connect, or alexa calling
for more information, see the above faq "what's the difference between alexa calling and echo connect
can i call emergency services with echo connect
yes, calling emergency services through echo connect works just like dialing any other phone number
simply say, "alexa, call 911
" please note that if echo connect is used to call emergency numbers like 911, the location information given to the emergency service, if any, may be the address associated with the phone line connected to your echo connect, which may not be the same as the location of your echo device from which you are making the call
echo connect will not function in the event of a power or broadband outage or other connectivity issues
if you are unable to place your call through your echo connect, you should use your mobile, landline telephone, or other telephone service
