our lives are full with family, work, social commitments, and more
most of us rely on smartphones and other digital devices to help us manage our daily responsibilities and to stay connected
back in 2006, as a dynamic, active community of faith, life
church began exploring ways that we could help people take advantage of emerging technologies to experience the bible in ways that would lead to life change
that led us to create the youversion bible app, one of the first 200 free apps in apple’s app store when it launched in 2008
as more and more people began using youversion, we recognised the value of helping people explore faith in a community with the shared purpose of growing their relationship with god in a safe and secure manner
youversion is far more than just an electronic reader that allows you to read the bible on your phone

we do not share personal information of youversion users with these third parties
we do, however, provide these third parties with aggregate analytics concerning the use of their content by country using de-identified and anonymised data
