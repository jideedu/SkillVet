how we use & share the information collected
the personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information

in addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on the websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the websites
this information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information
we may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the websites

a device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, and we may identify your device by its device identifier
when analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our websites are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the websites, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising
we may associate your device identifier or web site usage information with the personally identifiable information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information
web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following
web beacons -　small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 gifs" or "clear gifs") may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages

web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the websites, to monitor how users navigate the websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed

the code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the websites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter

in the latter case it will be treated as personally identifiable information

your california privacy rights
(a) residents of the state of california, under certain provisions of the california civil code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in california a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under california law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes

how we respond to browser "do not track" signals
some web browsers incorporate a "do not track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked
california business & professions code section 22575(b)(as amended effective january 1, 2014) provides that california residents are entitled to know how scripps networks interactive responds to "do not track" signals
how browsers communicate the do not track signal is not yet uniform so a standard technological response has not yet been developed by the policy and technological communities
for this reason, we do not respond to do not track signals currently, and we await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take
scripps does provide a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our websites, and that opt-out feature can be found here
the effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e
research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes)
third party ad server networks
the websites may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on the websites and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the websites
network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the websites and other websites you have visited
third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested
the websites’ third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your computer and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your computer via a device identifier
these third party cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things
(a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in
(b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times
and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you
note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities
third party cookies, web beacons, and other third party technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one
while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the websites, scripps does provide a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our websites, and that opt-out feature can be found here
you may wish to visit http
asp , which provides information regarding the practice of behavioral tracking by network advertising initiative ("nai") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of nai members
opting out of one or more nai members only means that those nai members will no longer be able to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other web sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads
in addition, opting out may still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e
, research, analytics and for internal online services operation purposes)
also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your nai opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective
additional information is available on the nai’s web site accessible by the above link

provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation
