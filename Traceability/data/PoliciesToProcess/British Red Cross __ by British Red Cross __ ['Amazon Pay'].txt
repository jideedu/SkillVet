legal, regulatory and tax compliance
where required we are subject to a legal obligation, we may process your personal information to fulfil that obligation

you can object to such use of your personal information for profiling at any time by contacting us at the details set out at the end of this privacy notice
our profiling and analysis activities can be broken into five categories
we may combine the personal information you have given us with data obtained from external sources, such as the office for national statistics, to infer the likely social, demographic and financial characteristics, so we can tailor our communications and services to better meet your needs or the needs of others like you based on the insight we gain from the profile we build
we will not use the results of this data matching activity in a way that intrudes on your privacy or your previously expressed privacy preferences
we conduct analysis of supporters by group, post code or particular area where supporters may be based
this is to ensure that campaigns or mailings are sent to those who will be most interested or likely to respond
this type of activity is not aimed at identifying specific individuals to target, but rather many individuals who may fall within a certain segment of supporters
we may carry out research to determine whether an individual could be a potential major donor
we may use publicly available information from third party sources such as google and companies house, published biographies, and publicly available linkedin profiles
the type of information we collect can include
history of giving to us and others
how the individual is connected with us and others
public information on any philanthropic activities
high value event planning
we may also use profiling to produce short biographies of people who are due to meet with our leadership or attend an event that we may be hosting
this helps our people to understand more about those we engage with, and their interests or connection to us
ethical screening and minimising risk
as a registered charity, we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory obligations and standards
the public naturally expect charities to operate in an ethical manner and this is integral to developing high levels of trust and demonstrating our integrity
this means that we may carry out appropriate due diligence of donors, check donations and implement robust financial controls to help protect the charity from abuse, fraud and/or money laundering
we may carry out background checks and due diligence on potential donors or anyone planning on making a significant donation or gift before we can accept it
we may also ethically screen supporters to minimise risk of creating an association with an individual or group that conflicts with the standards we have set out in our overarching ethical policy
