we look at which of our website pages you visit most or which destinations you visit most frequently to understand what you are most interested in
to understand more about your preferences and your purchasing habits - our data analytics tools and segmentation tools allow us to match data we collect from cookies with data we have about bookings you have made for travel on eurostar (both directly and through third parties)
sometimes we include data and/or systems provided by third parties as part of this process
we know that similar customers are interested in similar products and services, so we group similar customers together in ‘segments’
we use segment information to improve our communications with you and recommend to you those services we think will be most interesting to you, including new products and services offered by our partners
we also use it to make sure that we show you adverts which we think will be of most interest to you when you visit through our online advertising space
