with coronavirus (covid-19) now affecting many areas of our services to the residents and businesses of amber valley, we are keen to keep you right up-to-date with the changes we are being forced to make
read more about your council services
your privacy – keeping your personal information safe
amber valley borough council is committed to protecting your privacy when you use our services
the privacy notice below explains how we use information about you and how we protect your privacy
we have a data protection officer who makes sure we respect your rights and follow the law
if you have any concerns or questions about how we look after your personal information, please contact the data protection officer – email
or by calling 01773 841430
personal information can be anything that identifies and relates to a living person
this can include information that when put together with other information can then identify a person
for example, this could be your name and contact details
some of your personal information is classed as ‘special information’
some information is ‘special’ and needs more protection due to its sensitivity
it is often information you would not want widely known and is very personal to you
this is likely to include anything that can reveal your
sexuality and sexual health
religious or philosophical beliefs
physical or mental health
why do we need your personal information
we may need to use some information about you to
deliver services and support to you
manage those services we provide to you
help investigate any worries or complaints you have about your services
keep track of spending on services
check the quality of services
to help with research and planning of new services
how the law allows us to use your personal information
there are a number of legal reasons why we need to collect and use your personal information
each service area will have a privacy notice if it is necessary to collect and use your personal information in providing that service
generally we collect and use personal information where
you or your legal representative have given consent
you have entered into a contract with us
it is necessary to perform our statutory duties
it is necessary to protect someone in an emergency
it is required by law
it is necessary for employment purposes
you have made your information publicly available
it is necessary for legal cases
it is to the benefit of society as a whole
it is necessary to protect public health
it is necessary for archiving, research, or statistical purposes
if we have consent to use your personal information, you have the right to remove it at any time
if you want to remove your consent, please contact
and tell us which service you are using so we can deal with your request
we only use what we need
we will only collect and use personal information if we need it to deliver a service or meet a requirement
your rights as a data subject - what you can do with your information
the law gives you a number of rights to control what personal information is used by us and how it is used by us
subject access requests – the right of access
if we are processing your personal information you can ask for a copy that information – this is known as a subject access request
requests should be made in writing and you will be asked to fill in a request form
you are only entitled to your own personal data, and not to information about other people
before you are provided with your personal information you will be asked to provide two forms of identity to enable us to ensure that we are giving the information to the right person
there is usually no charge for providing this information, however a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs may be charged if the work involved in providing the information is excessive
in certain circumstances the law exempts organisations from providing personal data requested as part of a subject access request, for example if the data has been processed for the prevention and detection of crime, the prosecution of offenders or the assessment of tax then it may not be disclosed to you following a subject access request if disclosure is likely to prejudice any of the above purposes
you can ask us to change information you think is inaccurate – the right of rectification
if you think that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete you can ask us to put things right or provide us with additional information to make the data complete – this is called the right of rectification
we may not always be able to change or remove that information but we will correct factual inaccuracies and may include your comments in the record to show that you disagree with it
you can ask us to delete information – the right to erasure
in certain circumstances you may have the right to have your personal data erased
this is sometimes known as the “right to be forgotten
” this is not an automatic right
you cannot simply request that the council, or any other organisation, deletes all your personal data and expect it to automatically comply with your request as this right only applies in certain circumstances
this right applies to information held by the council if
it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was initially collected
you initially gave consent for your information to be used and you withdraw that consent
it did not have a legal basis for processing your information in the first place
the law says that certain information should be erased
the right to have data erased will not apply in all cases
for example, it will not apply if there is a legal obligation to continue to process the data, if it is necessary for the collection of local taxation, or if it is needed for legal proceedings, or for certain other duties undertaken by a public authority
you can ask to limit what we use your personal data for - the right to restrict processing
in addition to your right to ask for your data to be erased you also have the right to ask that the council stops processing your data on a temporary basis
your data won’t be erased, but instead we will not process it further until we have considered your request
you can ask us to temporarily restrict processing if
you think that there may be an inaccuracy with the personal information the council holds about you and you want the council to check this out
the council did not have a legal basis for processing your information in the first place, but you don’t want us to erase your data
the council no longer needs to keep your data, but you want us to as it is needed for legal proceedings
you have objected to the council processing your data and it is investigating whether its legitimate grounds for doing so override your rights as an individual
like the right to erasure, the right to ask us to restrict processing will not be applied in all cases
we may not comply with your request if we need to process your information as part of legal proceedings, to protect the rights of another person, or for reasons of important public interest, or if the request is unfounded or excessive
the right to object
in certain circumstances you have the right to object to the council processing your personal data
this right only applies in certain circumstances
you should explain why you think processing of your personal information is causing you substantial damage or distress, giving as much information as possible to enable the council to make a decision on your request
your right to object will not be applied if your data is being processed as part of legal proceedings or if legitimate grounds for processing outweigh the rights and interest of you as an individual or if the request is unfounded or excessive
who do we share your information with
we work with other organisations to help deliver our services to you
where we have these arrangements, there is always an agreement in place to make sure that the organisation complies with data protection law
sometimes we have a legal duty to provide personal information to other organisations
we may also share your personal information when we feel there is a good reason that is more important than protecting your privacy
this doesn’t happen often, but we may share your information in order to find and stop crime and fraud
or if there are serious risks to the public, our staff or to other professionals
to protect those who are thought to be at risk, for example if they are frail, confused or cannot understand what is happening to them
for all of these reasons the risk must be serious before we can override your right to privacy
how do we protect your information
we make sure we hold records about you (on paper and electronically) in a secure way, and we will only make them available to those who have a right to see them
examples of our security include
encryption, meaning that information is hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge (such as a password)
controlling access to systems and networks allows us to stop people who are not allowed to view your personal information from getting access to it
training for our staff allows us to make them aware of how to handle information and how and when to report when something goes wrong
regular testing of our technology and ways of working including keeping up to date on the latest security updates
how long do we keep your personal information
there is often a legal reason for keeping your personal information for a set period of time, we include all of these in our retention schedule
for each service the schedule lists how long your information may be kept for
where can i get advice
if you have any worries or questions about how your personal information is handled please contact our data protection officer at
or by calling 01773 841430
for independent advice about data protection, privacy and data sharing issues, you can contact the information commissioner’s office (ico) at
