profiling and personalized marketing 9
we think it is important for us to understand the types of vacations that our consumers are interested in so that we can make our marketing relevant and targeted
to do this, we use your personal data to build a profile for you that lets us work out which of our marketing segments is the best fit for you
2 the personal data we use
from the personal data that we hold about you, which includes the personal data we receive from our suppliers and our business partners, our model may consider your age, gender, household or travel composition, postcode, how you have interacted with our websites and marketing emails and your booking history (including your destinations, the ships you have sailed on and your chosen accommodation)
we do not always use all of these data categories if we do not have the information about you or it is not relevant for our marketing activities
3 how we build your profile and what we learn from it
(a) statistical analysis - we use the data above as inputs for a proprietary statistical model, the output of which can tell us about your previous or likely future booking behavior, for example
(i) the value or likely value of the bookings you make with us
(ii) whether you tend to re-book within 12 months of your last cruise and the destinations that you tend to book
and (iii) the extent to which you engage with our marketing emails
(b) marketing segments – we try to match every consumer with one or more pre-defined segments that allow us to broadly tailor our marketing messages for the right audience
we define our segments using anonymized demographic data based on broad characteristics and behaviors such as age, household income, or location
you will share a segment with other consumers, so this process is generally not highly individualized
4 here’s an example
let’s say you have just signed up on our websites (giving us your contact details) and you have never booked a cruise before
over the next few days you search for cruises that are generally popular with families (giving us website interaction data)
we might use that data to add you to one of our family segments so that you get relevant emails from us
5 what this means for you
tailoring our marketing campaigns to your profile or segment means you should receive more relevant communications from us
that’s good for us because we think you are more likely to book a vacation that matches your requirements
we hope that’s good for you, too, because it helps you to find the vacations that you are interested in
we might also send you special offers on your birthday
6 targeted advertising on third party social media platforms and websites
we may share your personal data – including your name, email address, address and date of birth – with third party social media platforms, including facebook, and websites for the purposes of allowing those platforms to display targeted advertisements to you
you can ask us not to share your personal data with platforms, but you will need to contact the platform with any requests in relation to how the platform uses your personal data because we do not control that
7 you can opt out
you are in control of your personal data
you can update your marketing preferences or opt out of personalized marketing at any time using your guest account or, where you do not have a guest account, by either clicking a link in an email marketing communication, replying stop to an sms text message or by calling the sender of any marketing communication
