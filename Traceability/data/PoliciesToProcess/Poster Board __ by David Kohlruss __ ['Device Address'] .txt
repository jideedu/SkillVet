what potentially personally identifiable information do you collect
we collect the address associated with your echo device and use that to create a localization profile for you (using google's geolocation api to create a latitude & longitude bounds in which your messages will be heard)
this information is stored alongside a userid generated by amazon's alexa sdk, along with a list of ids for messages you have recorded and listened to, as well as the most recent message you have recorded
what information do we not collect
we do not store the actual audio message that your alexa-enabled device has recorded -- all messages are stored as text
beyond what has been stated above, no other personally-identifiable information is accessed or stored by us
we do not collect your amazon username, email address, name, etc
we recommend that you use caution when submitting messages and avoid submitting any information that may identify you
how is the information shared
we do not share, sell, rent, or trade members’ personal information with third parties for their commercial purposes
the only times we’ll ever share the limited information that we store is
to assist in the investigation, prevention, or action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of service, or as otherwise required by law
how do you respond to legal requests for information
we won’t hand your data over to anyone unless a court order says we have to
we reject requests from law enforcement when they seek data without a court order
how is my information stored
we use aws to store all data that is stored and all code that is run in association with this skill
how is my information secured
data sent between your amazon account and the aws dynamodb database is sent using https
data that lives on our database is not encrypted, and as such, it is strongly recommended to avoid including any personally identifiable information when sending messages
what is your data retention policy
when your primary billing address with amazon changes, the new zip/postal code will be stored and a new localization profile is created
this replaces all previously stored data
logging of data processes is stored by aws
how do you notify people of changes to this policy
to stay up to date with any changes related to our privacy policy, use github’s watch feature on this skill's github repo to get notifications for any changes or proposed changes to our privacy policy
