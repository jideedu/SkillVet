section 4 - ecommerce
our store is hosted on shopify

your data is stored through shopify’s data storage, databases and the general shopify application
they store your data on a secure server behind a firewall

it is encrypted through the payment card industry data security standard (pci-dss)
your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction
after that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted
all direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by pci-dss as managed by the pci security standards council, which is a joint effort of brands like visa, mastercard, american express and discover
pci-dss requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers
