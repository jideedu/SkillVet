bin day - privacy policy
the aim of this policy is to inform users of the south glos and bristol bin day alexa skills how we collect and use their data
wherever this document refers to 'the authority' this refers to the relevant council in the area where the user's alexa device's address says it is
because refuse collection schedules are specific to small groups of properties it is necessary to collect the full address of the device from amazon when location-specific functions within the skill are accessed
this address information is used to identify the correct collection or subscription details for the property from the authority website, and it is then discarded
the specific data items used by this skill are
first line of property address
the functions within the skill that require this information are
'alexa, ask bin day when our next collection is
'alexa, ask bin day when our next black bin collection is
'alexa, ask bin day if i have a current green waste subscription'
the usage of this information
identification of the correct refuse collection schedule for the skill invoker, based on the assumption that the address configured in their alexa device is their home address
third parties to whom this information is distributed
either south gloucestershire or bristol council, via their refuse service web services, depending on which authority is relevant for the user
this data is immediately discarded after alexa has finished answering the query in hand
the skill creator can be contacted at andy@andrewarbon
