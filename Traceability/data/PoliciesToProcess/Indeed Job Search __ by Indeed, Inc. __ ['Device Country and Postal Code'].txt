if you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name
this means that third parties can view the personal data contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with indeed and for whom indeed has no responsibility
if you post a public resume on indeed, please note that although indeed expressly prohibits the scraping of its site any resume you post publicly is public information and the content may be copied by a third party in violation of these terms
for public resumes, you also authorize indeed to remove your name from your public resume, in certain instances
indeed may also change the display of your resume from public to private in certain instances to maintain the quality of the resume database
if you have a public resume, indeed may use information from your resume to auto-fill all or parts of a form or application
for example, if you use indeed chat, your name from your resume may appear in the messages
please note that resume search has not launched in all markets
if you are located in a market where resume search has not yet launched, setting your resume to public will make it available to anyone who visits the associated url
resumes set to public will become searchable upon the launch of resume search in your market
– changing your resume privacy settings
when you place your resume on indeed, it will be public by default
you may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on indeed
where you adjust your resume from public to private, indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information
additionally, employers who have saved your resume while it was public may continue to have access to your resume even after you have adjusted it to private

indeed may also provide the results of any indeed assessments you complete to employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such an assessment
indeed may also use information provided to indeed via your indeed resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes
if you have an indeed account or an indeed-hosted resume, you agree that indeed may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on indeed
in addition, if you are located in the united states and you set your resume to public, this means that indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with recruiters working for or on behalf of employers
if you do not wish to share such information, you may set your resume to private

we process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the site rules and other indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the site or any other indeed product or service
examples of such improvements would be improving the open rate of messages by optimizing their delivery, optimizing our search results, improving job listings, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam
as a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient

indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through indeed’s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system

8 facilitating telephone relay system between job seekers and employers
where applicable, indeed may offer job seekers and employers the option to avail of a telephone relay system to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications, conducting job interviews or other communication related to a job listing
such a system uses masked or proxy telephone numbers to protect users, and is only available to users who select it on the site
no recording of conversations or messages is performed through this relay system, although data relating to whether a call was answered and call duration may be gathered
such functionality is provided to indeed by third party service providers, such as twilio

we may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud
however, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur
these efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users
– preventing fraud and spam in messages
indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that indeed determines do not adhere to site rules or any of the terms of this agreement
indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on indeed by various means, including but not limited to investigating your functionality by setting up profiles and names that belong to indeed
indeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third party if indeed has a good faith belief that you are using the site in violation of these terms
indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay
this includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant job listing

in order to optimize the performance of the indeed site and services for users, indeed performs automated processing of personal data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning a user’s personal preferences or interests in terms of indeed’s site and services
where it occurs, such processing is carried out if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow indeed to provide its services to job seekers and employers, including analyzing applications and resumes on behalf of employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user’s consent
for example, in certain cases such processing allows indeed to match job seekers with employers effectively, to provide job seekers with job alerts and recommended jobs that the job seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular job seeker applications to an employer, to display search results, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users
such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this privacy policy to protect the privacy of our users, and you may contact privacy-dept @ indeed
