with other companies we hire to help us run our business
as part of a sale of a p&g brand or business to another company
to help us protect our rights or property, e
, fraud prevention or information security
when required by law or government authorities
you can tell us how we can use your information by clicking on the links below
if you live in the eu, you have certain personal data rights, including to access what personal information we have about you, make corrections or updates to it, tell us to delete that data, or receive a portable copy of that information
these rights don’t apply in all situations
please click the links below to
access or update personal information
request correction, deletion, or transfer of your personal information
how we collect your information
we collect information about you in many ways from many places
information we collect may include personal information that can be used to
for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or
in some countries like those in the eu, things like ip
address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered
we may combine all of the information we collect about you to give
you better products, services, and user experiences
you provide it to us
you give us your information when signing up for an account on our websites
or in mobile apps or by calling or emailing us
we may ask for things like
your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your
age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us
to send you information about our products and services—for example, to
your home address, email address, or by texting you
from sites and emails
we may use technologies that automatically collect information when you
visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services
for example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser)
to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your ip
address, web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have
not opened an email from us
from mobile applications and internet connected devices
to give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that
collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or from
“smart” devices in your home
you consent to do this when downloading the
app or installing household internet connected devices
could include your mobile phone or other device advertising id, information
about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, and
you will get a pop up notice on your phone or
device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know
your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are
we may get information that other companies share with or sell to us
example, you may have given consent for another company to share your
personal information with us when you signed up for telecom services or a
retailer loyalty points program
we may also collect information from
places that you know everyone can see, such as from internet postings, blog
entries, videos, or social media sites
we may also receive information
from other companies who are in the business of collecting or aggregating
information about you sourced from publicly available databases or from
consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your
this might be information about your income level, age,
gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on
the internet or from stores in your neighborhood
how we use your information
we use your information to help us meet our purpose of touching and
improving the lives of people like you every day around the world
your information to respond to your questions or requests for information,
send you products or samples you have requested, help you manage your
p&g site or app preferences, allow you to enter our contests or
sweepstakes, or process your payment for the products you buy from us
may also use your non-personal information (e
, purchase data, sample
) in consumer research or analytics (or personal information
when you have consented to participate in such research) to learn more
about what consumers want so that we can make new products or improve the
ones we already have
another way we use your information is to make sure that what you hear from
us is relevant and useful to you as an individual
for example, we may send
you information about gillette® products if you have shown interest in our
shaving products by visiting gillette
when we do this, we will use
your information – a cookie id or device id -- to limit the number of times
you see the same advertisement from gillette
we want you to hear from us
about the products you use and love without you hearing the same message
over and over again
we may also use aggregate information from many people without identifying
any individuals to better understand how our websites are being used or to
study consumer habits so that we can make products and offer services that
meet the needs of all consumers sharing some of the same things in common
for example, we can learn a lot about consumers who are new parents reading
our baby product websites, so that we can better serve new parents
everywhere with the products and services they want
non-personal information in this way helps to safeguard your privacy
will always try to use non-personal information whenever possible for this
to further protect your privacy, we will also use the least amount of
information we can to accomplish the task at hand, put measures in place to
prevent mixing information in ways that would allow cookie and device ids
to specifically and directly identify you (e
, by name), and delete your
information when we no longer need it for our business purposes
how we safeguard your information
we respect your personal information and take steps to protect it from
loss, misuse, or alteration
where appropriate, these steps can include
technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention
systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption
organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data
processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks,
restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring
physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being
when we have your consent, we may share your information with select
partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or
services we believe you may be interested in
for example, people who
receive p&g emails from our diaper brands such as pampers® may also
consent to hear about baby formulas made by other companies
we do not sell
your personal information to marketers outside of p&g
information that does not personally identify you with other companies for
we may need to share your information with companies who help us run our
business, including hosting our sites, delivering our emails to you,
analyzing the data we collect, and sending you the products and services

companies to complete the tasks we request
they are required to protect
your information in the same way we do and will not share it or use it for
if a brand or one of our businesses with which you’ve shared personal data
is sold to another company, your data will be shared with that company

cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web
they store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit
cookies do not collect any information stored on your computer or device or in your files
cookies do not contain any information that would directly identify you as a person
cookies show your computer and device only as randomly assigned numbers and letters (e
, cookie id abc12345) and never as, for example, john e
we use cookies for a number of reasons, such as
to serve you with relevant advertising
to learn more about the way you interact with p&g content
help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there
is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
to identify errors and resolve them
to analyze how well our websites are performing
these are the types of cookies we use
webpages have no memory
session cookies remember you (using a randomly
abc12345) as you move from page to page so that you
don’t get asked to provide the same information you’ve already given on
for example, session cookies are extremely helpful when
shopping online—without them the items you place in your shopping cart
would disappear by the time you reach the checkout
deleted as soon as you leave our site or close your browser
persistent cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you
for example, if you choose to read the site in french
on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear
not having to select a language preference
every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly
these cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally
might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the
this can also help us infer things about you such
your age, marital status, and how many kids you may have
allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the
things you like or need
it also allows us to limit the number of times
you see the same advertisement
these cookies tell us how our websites are working
in many cases, we
use google analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites
our ability to use and share information collected by google analytics
about your visits to our sites is restricted by the google analytics terms of use and the google privacy policy
how you can control cookies
you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
is being sent to your computer
however, this may prevent our sites or
services from working properly
you can also set your browser to delete
cookies every time you finish browsing
beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone
over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are
on-sale as you walk through a store
beacons only talk to your device
when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the
mobile application associated with a particular beacon
may provide us location information to help customize advertising and
for example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care
section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon
these are small objects embedded into a web page, but are not visible
they are also known as "tags,” “web bugs,” or "pixel gifs
pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website
activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing
we also include pixels in our promotional email messages or
newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them
mobile device identifiers and sdks
we use software code in our mobile apps to collect information similar
to what cookies collect on the internet
this will be information like
your mobile phone identifiers (ios idfas and android advertising ids)
and the way you use our apps
similar to cookies, the device
information we collect automatically as you use our apps will never
identify you as a person
we only know a mobile device as randomly
assigned numbers and letters (e
, advertising id efg4567) and never
as, for example, john e
we may receive information about your exact location from things like
global positioning system (gps) coordinates (longitude and latitude)
when you use our mobile apps
you will always get a pop-up notice on
your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to
know exactly where you are in the world
you should understand that we
will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a
broader city, postal code, or province
for example, we do not consider
it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in
when you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we
believe you would like to see
for example, you may receive advertisements
for tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that
sell children’s clothing or school supplies
and from that information we
may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested
in a powerful laundry-cleaning product
in this way, we intend to send you
relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you
we learn from groups of consumers sharing similar interests
we may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same
for example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados”
if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a
“bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts
we notice these things about you as you look at web pages, links
you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications
you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails
group together cookie and device ids to help us learn about general trends,
habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly
by doing this, we can find and serve many others who
“look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we
believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information
we link other information to your cookie and device ids
your cookie and device ids may be supplemented with other information, such
as information about the products you buy offline or information that you
provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites
do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you
example, we could know that cookie id abc12345 belongs to the razor
aficionado group based on person’s web site visits, age, gender, and
shopping habits, but we would not know that person’s name or address or
other information that would identify him or her as a person
ever want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and
app viewing history), we will always ask you before doing so
we may know you across all of your computers, tablets, phones, and
we may know that cookie id abc12345 is from a computer that that may be
connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with
this means that you may search for diapers on your
laptop, click on a google search result link which we have sponsored, and
then later see an ad for our pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone
we might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone
because, for example, they sign on to the same wifi network every day at
understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or
household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across all
and this is important because that way you don’t get
annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such
repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive
how you can stop receiving interest-based ads
to stop receiving p&g interest-based advertising, you can click here or click on the webchoices or appchoices icons on one of our sites or in
one of our mobile applications
you can also prevent
getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your
browser(s), declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually
present when you install them, or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on
you will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of
even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from
our brands on your computer or mobile devices
these ads, however, are
based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads
unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile
phone or computer viewing activities, contextual ads are ads shown to you
based on the context of the specific site you are visiting
you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at
nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly
new or expecting parents as visitors
you should also know that we may
still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for
other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer
research, or detecting fraud
deleting cookies also deletes your opt out
when you opt out of interest-based advertising, we send an opt-out cookie
to your browser that tells us that you no longer want to receive
interest-based ads from us
your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you
decide to delete all cookies
this means that you will need to
opt-out again if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads
