alexa, echo devices, and your privacy
amazon knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully and sensibly
alexa is a cloud service that you control with your voice and is always getting smarter—the more you use alexa, the more alexa adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences
we handle any personal information we receive through alexa in accordance with amazon’s privacy notice
this page provides additional detail about how we use your personal information to provide and improve your experience and our services
what happens when i speak to alexa
when you speak to alexa, a recording of what you asked is sent to amazon’s servers so our systems for speech recognition and natural language understanding can process and respond to your request
we associate your requests with your amazon account to allow you to access other amazon services (e
, so you can ask alexa to read your kindle books and play audiobooks from audible) and to provide you with a more personalised experience
for example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps alexa choose what songs to play when you say, “alexa, play music
at times, alexa may make recommendations to you based on your requests
for example, if you are a prime music user and you request a song that is not available through prime music, alexa may offer you the ability to subscribe to amazon music unlimited
alexa may also recommend alexa skills you might like based on the alexa skills you use
we also use your requests to improve our services, including training the speech recognition and natural language understanding systems
is alexa recording all my conversations
echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (alexa, amazon, computer or echo)
the device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word
no audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or alexa is activated by pressing a button)
how do i know when audio is being sent to the cloud
for echo devices, any time audio is sent to the cloud, a visual indicator appears on your device
for instance, the light ring on amazon echo will turn blue or a blue bar will appear on echo show
you can also configure certain echo devices to play a short audible tone any time audio is sent to the cloud
can i “mute” my echo device
our echo devices are equipped with a microphone on/off button
when the button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated
when the microphones are turned off, your device cannot stream audio to the cloud
can i review, manage and delete my voice recordings
you can review your voice recordings associated with your account, manage the use of your voice recordings in the development of new features, and delete those voice recordings one by one or all at once by visiting settings
alexa privacy in the alexa app or at https
does alexa use other information
depending on how you use alexa, we may also collect other types of information and use that information to provide and improve your experience and our services
here are some examples
smart home – if you interact with or operate a smart home product with alexa, such as a light, thermostat or outlet, we will receive information about that smart home product’s device type, features, and status, which allows you to see information about and control that product from your alexa app
alexa calling and messaging - if you use alexa calling and messaging and grant alexa access to your contacts, we will periodically import and store your contacts, which allows us to connect you with your contacts and identify the most likely contact you intend to call or message (e
, which bill you want to call when you ask alexa to “call bill”)
if you use alexa calling and messaging to send voice or text messages to another alexa calling and messaging user (e
, on echo, "alexa, send a message to mom" or, in the alexa app, tapping on the message icon on mom's contact card), we will process your messages in the cloud to convert voice messages to text, and vice versa
you can turn off alexa’s use of your messages to improve message transcription accuracy from alexa privacy in the settings menu of your alexa app or in the manage your content and devices section of your account
item or barcode scanning feature - if you use echo show’s item or barcode scanning feature, we will process the scanned image in the cloud to return search results from amazon
uk for the scanned item or barcode
you can delete the scanned images associated with your account by visiting the manage your content and devices page at www
voice profile – if you consent to create a voice profile, we will use recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and store it in the cloud so alexa can recognise your voice, call you by name, and do more to personalise your experience
creation of a voice profile is an optional feature and you can withdraw your consent and delete any voice profile you've created by selecting “delete my voice” in the alexa app
if your voice is not recognised for three years, we will automatically delete your voice profile
if you use a third party service through alexa, we will exchange related information with that third party so they may provide the service
for example, if you interact with a third party alexa skill, we provide the content of your requests (but not the voice recordings) to the skill so the skill can respond accordingly
if you use a third party alexa skill that requires your location (such as a car service) and grant the skill access to your location, we will share that information with the skill
information you provide to an alexa skill will be subject to the skill developer’s privacy practices
you can find the privacy notices provided to us by the developers of alexa skills that collect personal information on the detail page for those skills in your alexa app
some alexa skills are directed to children, as identified by the developers of those skills
kid skills are turned off by default
if you want to use kid skills, please turn all kid skills on in the settings menu of your alexa app
you can turn all kid skills off at any time by changing that setting
you can learn more about alexa in our alexa terms of use
