the developer of kindness counts, rak, wants you to know how
we use and protect the important information you provide to us
the following summarizes our policy, procedures and practices
for kindness counts to help you log kindnesses that can be associated with the specific state in the united states where your device is located, we first require that you consent to our accessing that state information
that information plus the information you provide regarding each individual kindness you log is saved in a database that also contains your amazon account number
that information is not shared with any entity and is used only to enable you to retrieve aggregate information about the kindness information you have logged and the identities of the states with the most kindnesses, adjusted by state population, for the current and previous quarters
