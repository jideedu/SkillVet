how we collect personal data
we collect your personal data when you choose to provide it as you interact with us in person, through correspondence, by phone, by social media, or through our websites or apps
for instance, when you join aarp or register for an account on our websites or apps, you will be asked to provide basic personal data as part of your enrollment
similarly, you may be asked to provide certain personal data when you participate in aarp events or meetings, submit a contest or sweepstakes entry, respond to a survey, volunteer, request a program service, or apply for employment
for example, the personal data you provide might include
contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone numbers, and email address
payment information, such as your payment card number and expiration date
demographic information, such as your age, date of birth, gender, and employment and occupation information
login and access credentials for your aarp website and app registrations, such as your username, password, password reminders and answers
content you create or submit, such as correspondence, photographs, survey responses, public forum or message board postings, social network information
communication preferences, such as which emails and newsletters you wish to receive, whether you wish to receive text messages or phone calls, and whether you wish to receive push notifications in our apps
information needed as part of a service program offering you request (e
employment application information, including the types of information described above, plus other employment-related data like social security number, employment status, employment history, education information, references, résumé, immigration status and ability to work legally in the united states, personal or family employment affiliation with aarp, and, on a voluntary basis, for our equal employment opportunity compliance purposes for jobs located in the us, gender, race and ethnic background
data we collect by automated means
we collect data (some of which may be personal data) by automated means when you interact with us through our websites and apps, and when we communicate with you by email or text message
we use standard technologies, including browser cookies, web beacons, and third-party analytics services to collect this behavioral and operational data, which may be recorded and retained in web logs and other aarp systems
the collection of such data is a common practice that supports digital services,and is used to provide customized digital experiences, as well as for market research, marketing, analytics, and system administration purposes
for example, we may use this data to determine whether you’ve previously visited our website, to store your preferences and settings, and to provide authentication processes so you can more easily access your account
we also may use this data to target custom content and ads to you on our websites, in our apps, and through other digital communications, as well as on third-party websites and apps as described in the targeted advertising section below
examples of the data we may automatically collect as part of our website, app, and digital communication experiences include
your device and browser type, your operating system version, and your language settings
your internet service provider (isp)
your internet protocol (ip) address, mobile advertising id, media access control (mac) address, or similar identifiers
the website that referred you to our website, or that you visit upon leaving our website via a link from our site
the times and dates that you visit our websites or use our apps, and the duration of such use
information about areas of our websites or apps that you visited or used, as well as specific content or advertisements you viewed or links you clicked
information that identifies the precise physical location of your mobile device, based on your specific consent (we may use your ip address to generally estimate your location without seeking your specific consent – but such data does not provide a precise location)
information collected through cookies, web beacons, analytics tools, and other similar technologies
a “cookie” is a small data file that a website sends to and stores on your device that allows the site to recognize your browser or store information or settings
the cookie itself does not contain personal data, but can be read by the entity that placed the cookie and may allow it to associate your device to personal data
we may use “persistent” and/or “session” cookies
persistent cookies are stored on your computer and used for various purposes by your browser on subsequent website visits (such as to avoid having to reenter your log-on credentials)
session cookies are temporarily held in your computer’s memory and erased after you end a browser session or shut off your computer
a web beacon (sometimes called transparent or single pixel “gifs”) is an invisible digital object embedded in a webpage or email
web beacons are typically used to monitor your interaction with the webpage or email
web beacons can help us count visitors, determine whether emails are opened, how long a webpage is viewed, and perform similar functions
our webpages may contain web beacons from third parties, which help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and assess website operations
analytics tools allow us to measure and assess how users interact with our websites, apps, and digital communications
these services are typically provided by third-parties with whom we contract – primarily adobe and google analytics
these providers may use many of the same technologies discussed above (such as cookies and web beacons) to collect various data points associated with your visits to our websites and use of our apps
we may also collect data (some of which may be personal data) by automated means when you call our customer service center
for instance, we may record audio of these calls for quality control, training, security, and analytics purposes
you have choices to limit the collection and use of some of this data as described in the your personal data choices section of this privacy policy
data we collect from other sources
we may collect personal data about you from unaffiliated sources with whom we contract, such as product and service providers and data aggregators, as well as from public sources or databases
we may obtain data such as your name, postal address, telephone number, demographic data (such as age, gender, income level, and purchasing profiles), and publicly observed data (such as activity on blogs, videos, and other online postings)
we generally use such data to identify potential members or other individuals we try to reach as part of our non-profit mission, to update personal data we already have about current members and other individuals (such as an address update), or to enhance our data models
we may also purchase or license personal data lists from unaffiliated sources and provide access to those lists to other entities
although we may enhance such lists by applying our data models (e
, to predict behaviors or interests of 50+ consumers), we do not contribute personal data related to aarp members, volunteers, etc
, to such lists
we may also work with unaffiliated websites that allow you to sign up for an aarp membership or aarp emails directly from the third-party’s website
the personal data you provide on such sites is governed by that site’s privacy policy
but some or all the personal data you submit on such sites may also be shared with aarp and will be treated by aarp under the terms of this privacy policy when we receive it
we sometimes offer opportunities for our website or app users to forward information about or from aarp to a family member or friend through “refer a friend” mechanisms
when an individual uses such a mechanism, we may ask that they provide us the friend’s name and email address – as well as the individual’s own name and email address
we will only use the friend’s personal data to send the requested email or other information, and we may identify that we are doing so at the other individual’s request
we may combine personal data from various sources, and may combine non-personal data with personal data
when we do so, the combined information is treated as personal data under this policy unless it is later de-identified or otherwise disassociated from your personal data
we will not collect additional personal data or use the personal data we have collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice
how we share personal data
we may disclose your personal data to a third-party for a business purpose or sell your personal data (subject to your right to opt-out of those sales if you are a california consumer
see below in your california privacy rights
when we disclose personal data for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal data confidential and not use it for any purpose except performance of the contract
except as described below, we do not share your personal data with unaffiliated entities (entities that are not owned or controlled by aarp) without your consent
we may, however, share anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate data, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you – even where it has been derived from personal data
similarly, we may share personal data lists that we purchase or rent from unaffiliated sources after we apply our data models as previously described
you may limit certain sharing of your personal data as described below in your personal data choices
we share your personal data with the following categories of third-parties for the following purposes
we may share personal data with aarp licensed service providers, which are unaffiliated entities that make available aarp-branded products or services (such as insurance products or financial services) and/or discounts (such as at hotels or restaurants) to aarp members
these licensed service providers pay a fee for the right to use our brand and access our membership list and related data
these fees are used to support our non-profit mission
licensed service providers are required to treat the personal data aarp provides as confidential, and to use the personal data only to offer, provide, maintain, and analyze the contracted products, services, or discounts to aarp members
some of these licensed service providers may collect personal data about our members through their own interactions with those members, and may share some or all of this data with aarp to help us provide more effective and personalized service
we will use such data in accordance with this privacy policy
the licensed service providers’ own data collection and sharing practices are governed by their privacy policies, not this privacy policy
you can obtain a list of these licensed service providers here
we may share personal data with unaffiliated companies or individuals we hire to provide services or perform business functions on our behalf (such as print, mail, or email vendors
digital advertising and analytics vendors
and contest or sweepstakes operators) because these vendors need access to the personal data to perform the functions we’ve requested of them
these vendors are contractually required to treat the personal data we provide as confidential, and to use the personal data only to provide the services we have requested they perform on our behalf
we may share your personal data with banks or other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction purposes
we may occasionally share personal data, or engage in “list exchanges,” with select non-profit organizations when we believe such data sharing is in the best interest of our members and non-profit mission
social media advertising networks
we may share personal data with social media networks to facilitate their delivery of our customized advertising or messages on their network
the limited personal data we provide as part of the networks’ custom audience programs (generally email addresses) facilitates the delivery of our content to the right social media user
these networks only use the personal data we provide to identify you for these purposes
the delivery of customized social media ads or other content, and your ability to opt-out, is governed by the privacy policies of the social media companies, not this privacy policy
aarp may also share your personal data with other third parties as follows
pursuant to legal requirements
we may disclose your personal data (1) if we believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process, such as in response to a court order, subpoena, or similar investigative demand
(2) as we deem appropriate or necessary in response to requests for cooperation from a law enforcement agency, taxation authority, or other government agency
and (3) to defend against legal claims, exercise our legal rights, or as otherwise required by law
to protect ourselves, our members, or others
we may disclose your personal data when we believe disclosure is necessary (1) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing
(2) to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our organization, our members, our volunteers, our employees, our websites and apps users, or others
and (3) to enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements or policies
in connection with business transfers
we may disclose or transfer your personal data in the unlikely event of a direct or indirect reorganization process or negotiation involving aarp or a subsidiary (including, without limitation, in the event of a bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation), although the use of such data following the transfer will remain subject to the terms of this privacy policy
how we protect personal data
we use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use
despite our safeguards, however, no website, app, or information system can ever be completely secure so we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites, or apps will be completely safe or secure
for additional information on privacy, identity theft, and online security, please visit the u
federal trade commission's website
if we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps
by using our websites and/or apps, or otherwise providing personal data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of our websites and apps
we may post a notice via our websites if a security breach occurs
we may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances
depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing
your personal data choices
if you wish to review and/or request changes to certain personal data we have collected about you (such as your current contact information, username and password, or date of birth), you may do so by logging into your aarp account on aarp
org or the aarp now app, or by contacting us as identified above
in some cases, you may also have a right to (i) request deletion of certain personal data or (ii) obtain a copy of such data in an accessible format
we will make reasonable attempts to comply with such requests where applicable, but may refuse requests where we are otherwise legally required to retain the data, or the requests are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, risk the privacy of others, or are impractical
if you would like to request that we no longer share personal data with aarp licensed service providers and/or unaffiliated non-profit organizations, you may do so by completing our privacy opt-out form or by contacting us as identified above
if you make such a request, it will not prevent such third-parties from using any personal data we shared with them prior to completing the opt-out process, or any data they have collected directly from you or others
you may choose to opt-out of some or all future communications (mail, email, phone) from aarp
you can do so by completing our privacy opt-out form or by contacting us as identified above
for email, you can also opt-out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” links in the footer of our emails
(please note that when opting-out of emails, you may still receive “transactional” emails, which contain information you specifically request or information related to your membership purchase or renewal
) for phone or text messages, you can also opt-out by following the contact instructions we provide in the phone call or replying “stop” to any text message to which you’ve previously consented
we will honor your opt-out requests as soon as practical and as required by applicable law
most web browsers can be set to reject cookies or provide notice when cookies are placed on your device
each browser is different, so check the "help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences
although it is up to you whether to accept cookies from our websites, if you reject cookies, certain functions on our sites may not work properly, and your ability to use some areas of the websites may be limited
it is also important to note that the opt-out mechanisms described in the targeted advertising section below generally rely on cookies to retain your opt-out preferences
so if you reject or erase cookies, your opt-out choices may not function properly
our analytics providers for websites and apps, primarily adobe and google analytics, may collect data points associated with your visits to our websites and use of our apps in order to assist us with analyzing and assessing our digital properties
you can, however, opt-out of certain data collection by these analytics providers
to learn more about adobe analytics and how to opt-out of their data collection, click here

aarp participates in the adobe marketing cloud device co-op to better understand how you use our websites and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions
although participation in the co-op does not involve sharing personal data, it does assist all participants in recognizing various devices linked to the same person
you can learn more about how adobe does this and manage your choices (or opt-out) by visiting adobe’s device co-op privacy control website
we collect data (both directly and through third-parties) about your activities on our websites and apps and may combine it with other personal data we have about you for use in providing more customized experiences, including advertising tailored to your individual interests
we may also share data about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties, which may use many of the same technologies previously discussed (such as cookies, web beacons, and analytics tools) to track your online activities over time and across websites
this collection and ad targeting takes place both on our websites and apps and on third-party digital properties that participate in those ad networks
as a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activity on our websites and apps, and vice versa
the digital advertising alliance (daa) has created guidance for online advertisers and provided the “adchoices” mechanism for such advertisers to comply with users’ choices regarding the placement of interest-based ads
by clicking on the adchoices icon presented in the corner of each ad served by participants in the adchoices program, you will be directed to a webpage to allow opt-outs from that ad network and/or for all ad networks participating in the adchoices program
to learn more about ad networks, including how to opt out of interest-based ads, click here
we have also implemented on many of our websites a targeted ad choice tool provided by evidon
this tool can help you understand what data is being collected on our websites by third-parties, and how you can control such collection and use
on our sites where the tool has been implemented, such as on aarp
org, you will see a reference to “adchoices” in the webpage footer – near the link to this privacy policy
by clicking on that link you will open a browser window that identifies each entity that aarp uses to direct targeted advertisements to you, both on aarp websites as well as on third-party sites
if you would like to stop targeted advertising from aarp, you can manage these advertisements through the choices presented in the evidon tool
you will still see ads from aarp and the ad networks with whom we work, but they will not be based on targeted data
it is important to note that your choice to stop targeted advertising is specific to the browser you are using
if you make a choice to opt-out from one computer browser and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer and/or browser, you must also opt-out from that computer
it is also important to note that most of these choices are cookie-based
if you delete cookies after making an opt-out choice, you will need to perform the opt-out again
you can manage targeted ads in our apps through your device operating system settings
for ios apps, visit the “advertising” controls in your privacy settings
for android apps, use the settings app
both operating systems allow you to opt-out of targeted ads and/or reset your device advertising id
we may also work with certain social media websites or platforms (such as facebook or twitter) to serve ads to you as part of a customized social media campaign
you can opt-out of receiving customized ads by changing your ad preferences on those platforms, which we do not control
we will request your permission before our apps access precise location data for your mobile device, generally when you first launch our apps
if you have previously consented to our app accessing precise location information, you may revoke that permission at any time through your device’s operating system location preference controls
you may also stop our access to precise location data by following the standard uninstall process to remove our apps from your device
in addition to using the mechanisms described above, you may contact us at any time regarding these choices as follows
