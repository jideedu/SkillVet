how and why we collect and use personal data and other information
in order to operate the services and to maximize your experience, we may collect and use information, some of which may be considered personal data
please note that you may choose not to provide us with certain information
by doing so, however, you may not be able to receive the full range of services from us
we collect information in the following ways
information provided by you
you may choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the services in the following ways
complete a survey — for example, you may choose to provide us an e-mail address so that we can contact you about your survey response
enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion — for example, you may provide your telephone number and home address and we may be legally obligated to disclose this information if you win
send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form to receive additional information — for example, you might e-mail us with a question and we will use your e-mail address to respond to your inquiry
submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video — for example, you might submit a cool photo of a weather event you experienced that we may post on the services so others can enjoy it
special note about content submissions
the services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings or other materials on or to the services (collectively, "submissions")
any geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in submissions may become publicly available
any information, including personal data, in your submissions can be read, collected, or used by others
we cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your submissions
engage with interactive advertising — we may receive the information you provide when you submit oral or written questions or comments via the interactive ads that are placed on the services or on third-party platforms
and we may share this information with our ad partners and advertisers
customize the services — for example, you might set a "home" location so that every time you visit the services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location
we also collect certain information through automated means
some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data
for example, we automatically collect
information about your device and device capabilities
information about your device operating system
information about your browser
information about how you use the services
your activities on the services
mobile or internet carrier
this information helps us to understand, analyze, and measure how users use the services
deliver and measure the effectiveness of advertisements
and facilitate your access to and use of the services
we, our service providers, and our ad and analytics partners (see section 2 for more information) may collect location information through the services
we may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in section 3
we collect location information to provide you with location-based services (such as severe weather alerts and other weather information through our mobile applications), provide advertisements that are relevant to your geographic location, and conduct analytics to improve the services
the ways in which we collect location information, and the type of location information we collect, depend on the devices you use to access the services and the settings for those devices
if you are accessing the services through the site, we may detect your general location so that we can automatically show you the weather for your general area
depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so
if you do not allow it, or your browser does not permit it, only your general location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device
even if we are unable to collect direct location information on your device, you may manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country)
on mobile web, if you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content that is relevant for the city you have entered in the search bar (i
, contextual city name)
if you access the services on your mobile device, we may, depending on your application and operating system settings, directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via global positioning system (gps), cellular network information, and other location-based features
depending on your mobile device's operating system, we typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter
the precision of latitude and longitude varies greatly and is determined by various factors including those controlled by your device, operating system, or mobile service provider
if you allow any of the weather channel mobile applications to directly collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection
this may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be travelling
we also use this location information to conduct analytics, provide relevant advertisements, and improve the services
you can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device
if you turn off location-based services, you may continue to receive alerts for locations that you have selected within the services
certain services offer you the ability to receive push notifications for weather-related updates
to provide these services, we may need to collect your device information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains
our hands-free audio alerts allow you to receive voice alerts for weather-related updates while you likely are driving
in order to provide you with hands-free alerts, we will need to collect your device's motion data solely to detect when you likely are in a moving vehicle
you can choose to stop sharing your device's motion data at any time, but hands-free alerts are only available when your device's motion data is being shared
if you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular service for which you registered, or by deleting the application
information from analytics and advertising partners
where legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the services from our vendors and other third parties such as analytics providers or advertisers
we may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources
if we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this privacy policy
data collection technologies and consumer choice
we and third parties acting on our behalf or on behalf of our partners use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our services and track usage behavior so that we may tailor information and personalize advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge
we follow the self-regulatory principles of the digital advertising alliance ("daa"), the digital advertising alliance of canada ("daac"), and the european interactive digital advertising alliance ("edaa")
we work with a variety of third-party advertising services ("ad partners"), and advertisers that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) in order to serve relevant ads
ad partners use various technologies on the services on our site and within our mobile applications to (among other purposes)
track how the services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the services
and serve more relevant ads on and within the services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit
ad partners and advertisers may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements
more information about this type of advertising is available from the network advertising initiative's website at www
we also contract with certain third parties that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the services ("analytics partners")
information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data
we and our partners may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the services
use of cookies, web beacons, and information saved by other technologies
third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services
the data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to
cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser
cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies
some cookies on our services collect ip and mac addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions
cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device
you can find more information about cookies at www
the cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways
these cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the services and its features
these cookies collect information about how you use the services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages)
in general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you
however, some such cookies may collect geoip or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions
these cookies allow services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news)
these cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the services
these cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits
they are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators
they collect information about your interactions over time with the services as well as with third-party websites and online services
this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests
these cookies are generally generated by content embeds
they allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments
certain pages on the services contain web beacons
web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the ip address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the url of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party
we use local storage, such as html5 localstorage and indexeddb, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e
, volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the services
local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text
by itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device
use of advertising identifiers
we and our ad partners may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising
an advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device to help advertising services
these user-resettable identifiers have different names depending on the operating system — google advertising id (gaid) on android devices and identifiers for advertisers (idfa) on ios
advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number
your choices around cookies, advertising identifiers, and other technologies used by advertisers, ad networks, and ad servers
this privacy policy does not cover the practices of our ad partners outside of our services and we do not control our ad partners' technologies
we provide links to more information about our approved partners and any available opt-out pages here (ad partners) and here (analytics partners)
for more information on web-related opt outs and mobile application-related opt outs, see sections 2
the opt outs described below are device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices
so, if you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices
if you choose to opt out through any of our ad partners' sites, you still may see advertisements but the advertisements will not be based on your interests
you can also opt out of future information collection from the services by adjusting the settings on your device, ceasing use of the service on web, or un-installing the relevant mobile application
for more information about our ad partners' technologies, how they use the information collected by the technologies on the services, and your options not to accept cookies placed by some ad partners on the services, please visit the daa's opt-out page , the digital advertising alliance of canada's (daac's) opt-out page , or one of the edaa's country-specific opt-out pages
in certain jurisdictions, you may also opt out of additional third-party advertising networks by going to the network advertising initiative's website
your browser, such as internet explorer, chrome, firefox, or safari, may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage
because each browser is a little different, we encourage you to check your browsers' "help" feature to learn how to block cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, and how to disable existing cookies
please note, however, that without some cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the services and some parts of the services may not function properly
for more information about managing cookies, please visit
mobile application-related opt outs
you can opt out of personalized advertising on android and ios through your device settings

data collection technologies and consumer choice
we and third parties acting on our behalf or on behalf of our partners use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our services and track usage behavior so that we may tailor information and personalize advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge
we follow the self-regulatory principles of the digital advertising alliance ("daa"), the digital advertising alliance of canada ("daac"), and the european interactive digital advertising alliance ("edaa")
we work with a variety of third-party advertising services ("ad partners") and advertisers that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) in order to serve relevant ads
ad partners use various technologies on the services on our site and within our mobile applications to (among other purposes)
track how the services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the services
and serve more relevant ads on and within the services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit
ad partners and advertisers may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements
more information about this type of advertising is available from the network advertising initiative's website at www
we also contract with certain third parties that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the services ("analytics partners")
information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data
we and our partners may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the services
use of cookies, web beacons, and information saved by other technologies
third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services
the data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to
cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser
cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies
some cookies on our services collect ip and mac addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions
cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device
you can find more information about cookies at www
the cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways
these cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the services and its features
these cookies collect information about how you use the services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages)
in general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you
however, some such cookies may collect geoip or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions
these cookies allow services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news)
these cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the services
these cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits
they are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators
they collect information about your interactions over time with the services as well as with third-party websites and online services
this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests
these cookies are generally generated by "sharing" buttons
they allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments
certain pages on the services contain web beacons
web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the ip address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the url of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party
we use local storage, such as html5 localstorage and indexeddb, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e
, volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the services
local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text
by itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device
use of advertising identifiers
we and our ad partners may collect information about a user's movement within and usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising
an advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device to help advertising services
these user-resettable identifiers have different names depending on the operating system — google advertising id (gaid) on android devices and identifiers for advertisers (idfa) on ios
advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number
your choices around cookies, advertising identifiers, and other technologies used by advertisers, ad networks, and ad servers
this privacy policy does not cover the practices of our ad partners and we do not control our ad partners' technologies
we provide links to more information about our approved partners and any available opt-out pages here (ad partners) and here (analytics partners)

in certain jurisdictions, you may also opt out of additional third-party advertising networks by going to the network advertising initiative's website
your browser, such as internet explorer, chrome, firefox, or safari, may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage
because each browser is a little different, we encourage you to check your browsers' "help" feature to learn how to block cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, and how to disable existing cookies
