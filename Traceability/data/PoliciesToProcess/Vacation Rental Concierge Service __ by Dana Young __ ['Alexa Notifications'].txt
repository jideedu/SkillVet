our lawful bases include

sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data

we sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests
for example, we may use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the services secure
we may also send you promotional communications about our services, subject to your right to control whether we do so

some examples of the types of cookies and other technologies vcs uses

localization some cookies help us provide localized experiences — for example, by making sure you see vcs in your preferred language
site features and services vcs uses cookies that provide functionality and help us deliver our products and services — for instance, by storing your preferences or by pre-filling the username field when you log in

for example, we may use cookies to determine which types of browsers or devices are accessing vcs

cookies help us deliver targeted advertisements on social media platforms, based on your activity on vcs, and to track the performance of those ads
this is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising
