because we are a company located in scotland the personal information that you give us or that we collect from you will be held under scottish and european union data protection legislation (but we’ll just refer to this as “ the legislation ”)

changes to our privacy policy
we may need to change this privacy policy if it’s necessary for legal reasons or to reflect changes to our services
in any case, the provisions of this privacy policy may be changed without prejudice to your rights
when we change our privacy policy we will make the updated privacy policy available on our site and we will also update the “last updated” date
once we change our privacy policy, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it on our site
during that period you’re welcome to contact us if you have questions about the changes
if you don’t agree with our changes to the privacy policy (regardless of whether you get in touch with us) then, unfortunately, we may need to restrict or limit your use of the parts of our site that require your personal information in order for us to deliver our services to you
we’re sorry we have to say that, but we hope you’ll appreciate that in order for certain parts of our site to work properly and in order for us to identify you in connection with our services we need to have everyone using our site and our services under the same rules instead of different people having different rules – that’s why we encourage you to get in touch with us if you have queries
if you have any questions, comments or requests regarding our privacy policy then please do not hesitate to get in touch with us
to make things easier for both of us we would appreciate if your queries were addressed to our privacy officer
