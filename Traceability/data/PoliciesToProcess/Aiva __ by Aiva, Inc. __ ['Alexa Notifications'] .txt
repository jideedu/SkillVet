this privacy policy explains how the careteam app uses and collects data to better connect patients with their caregivers
aiva offers a communication service system (“the aiva communication system”) which is designed to improve communication between patients and their caregivers
the aiva communication system makes use of voice-controlled, internet-connected devices (“voice assistants”) installed at the facilities of healthcare providers, as well as mobile applications, to receive requests made by patients (or their caregivers) and direct them to appropriate caregivers or systems
caregivers receive the requests through the careteam app
caregivers may use the careteam app to receive, review, respond to, and monitor requests
information we collect about users of the aiva communication system we collect certain information about users of the aiva communication system in order to operate the aiva communication system and to improve it
users include anyone who sends or receives requests using the aiva communication system (like patients or their caregivers) and anyone who otherwise accesses the aiva communication system (like providers)
the aiva communication system is designed to collect requests from patients (or their caregivers) using voice assistants or mobile applications
