key principles first things first
we use apps and websites like these, too
we want our information to be safe when we use other services, and we want you to know that your information is safe when you use ours
that's our bottom line, and we want to know if you ever feel like that's not the case
because your privacy is our top priority, we
do encrypt your data whenever it is stored or moved between parts of our service do minimize the information that anyone else using our service can see about you
don't ask for personal information unless we can properly secure it don't store personal information on our servers unless it’s required for us to provide you this service don't share your personal information with anyone except to develop and provide our service, comply with the law, or protect your rights and ours here is our privacy policy, which incorporates the above principles
introduction this privacy policy applies to amity mobile apps, websites, and other software components (“our service”)
it is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while you are using our service
if you have questions about this policy, please contact copiri at support@copiri
definitions throughout this privacy policy we’ll talk about two different types of data
here’s what we mean by each
non-personally-identifying information (“non-pii”) is any piece of information, or any group of pieces of information, that does not in and of itself identify a specific person
non-pii is often tangential
the fact that you have a nose, for example, is something about you that can be confirmed when someone already knows who you are
it does not, however, uniquely identify you on a planet full of other people with noses
personally-identifying information (“pii”) is any piece of information, or any group of pieces of information, that can be used to identify a specific person
pii can enter our service through a variety of methods, and can be entered by you, by us, by administrators of our service, or by other users
no matter how we receive pii, however, we will store and process it in accordance with this privacy policy
non-pii we collect and how it is used as you use our service, we collect information about your usage
this information is typically of the sort that browsers and servers make available, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, the date and time of your request, etc
our purpose in collecting non-pii is to better understand how you are using our service
from time to time we may release non-pii in the aggregate (for example, by publishing statistics about how many people have visited our site in the last 30 days)
pii we collect and how it is used when you choose to use our service, we ask for information that can be used to uniquely identify you
the amount and type of pii that we gather depends on how you choose to use our service
if you use amity, for example, we ask for your name, email address, and lodge/grand lodge affiliation, at a minimum
depending on the features of our service that you use, we may ask for more
we can’t show you nearby lodges, for example, unless you give us your location
in any case, we only collect enough information as we need in order to fulfill the purpose of your use of that part of our service
you can always refuse to provide the information we ask for, but that may prevent you from being able to access parts of our service
we also collect information about your usage that could be pii
this includes data like your
internet protocol (ip) address (as part of our web server’s standard logging process) or your location (when you have enabled location services in your app or browser)
we use this information to do things like fight spam, troubleshoot geographically-localized problems, and provide you with the parts of our service that require it
whether or not this data can uniquely identify you, though, we treat it as if it can
aggregated statistics we collect data about your (and other masons’) behavior as you use our service, in order to understand and improve your experience
this data may contain pii and/or non-pii
we may then anonymize the data by removing the pii and aggregating it into general statistics
we may then display the statistics publicly (for example, which parts of our service are most popular
), or provide them to others
how we protect your pii our baseline policy is that we do not disclose pii to anyone
we don’t rent it, we don’t sell it, and we don’t give it away
there are times where sharing is necessary, though, and for those times we have developed strict processes to make sure that your pii remains protected
so, let’s be really clear about this
we may share your pii with our employees, partners, or vendors… but only if they (a) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf (for example, a credit card processor for dues payments), and (b) have agreed not to disclose it to others
in addition, if this type of situation arises, we provide only the pii that is absolutely necessary, and no more
because we provide our service to masons like you all over the world, some or all of our employees may be located outside of your home country
by using our service, you agree that your pii can be transferred to them, in their home country, so that they can do their jobs
all of our employees have committed to uphold this policy and protect your data
we may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so
this may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the united states where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards
we may access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity
to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations
or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm
generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than where the law requires it, and in the case where our legal basis is consent you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time
since the law requires your consent for processing data which may reveal “philosophical beliefs,” however, and since your membership in a masonic lodge falls into this description, withdrawal of your consent means that we will delete your account from our systems
please refer to the “legal bases for processing your data” section to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data
now, this is important
no matter how much we work to protect your privacy, we can’t control what other masons do with your information
if you are a member of lodge that uses our service, your lodge’s leadership (typically your secretary and grand secretary and/or their delegates) can access some personal information you provide (such as your contact information, which they should already have, but not such as your payment details, messages, and other details that they would not reasonably have)
your fellow masons can also view what you choose to share among your group
emails from us if we have received your email address (whether directly from you, or from another person or lodge who uses our service), we may occasionally send you emails to let you know about activity related to you in your group
we may also email you periodically to tell you about new features, to solicit your feedback, or to keep you up to date with what we’re up to
you may choose to opt out of most of these emails using the links at the bottom of each email
we will always email you about changes to important things like this privacy policy
legal bases for processing your data copiri’s processing of your data falls into two categories, which are described in detail as follows
we have a contractual relationship because you have requested a service from copiri (for example, the ability to find lodges near you using amity), even though the service is provided at no cost, the law’s view is that you have entered into a contractual relationship with copiri
our legal basis for storing and processing your data in these cases is that it is required in order to provide the service to you, and we will retain your personal data for as long as you continue to use the amity app
you have provided consent some types of information, such as the fact of your membership in a masonic lodge (which, in the law’s view, may reveal “philosophical beliefs”), require your specific consent in order for us to store and process it
you provided that consent when you registered for amity, which was the same point at which you provided this data to copiri
you can find amity’s privacy policy here, and the app’s terms of service here
they are also available by visiting the “about” page in the app
your personal data will not be subject to any automated processing, including profiling, as defined under the law
your legal rights if the general data protection regulation applies to you because you are in the european union, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data
to the best of our abilities and where consistent with applicable law, we provide these rights to all of our users
the right to be informed about how we use your personal data (which we are sharing in this privacy policy)
the right to know about about any profiling we do, or any automated decision making that we perform (we don’t do either of those)
the right to request access to your data, and to receive from us a copy of the personal data we hold about you
the right to receive the copy of your personal data that you request from us in a common format (for example, a
csv file), if you request it
the right to correct any errors that you find in the personal data that we hold about you
the right to have the personal data we hold about you deleted, in certain circumstances (unless there’s an overriding legal reason we need to keep it)
the right to restrict processing of your personal data, in certain circumstances
and the right to object to the processing your personal data
these rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them
please see the eu’s gdpr website for more details
if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at support@copiri
you will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of the other rights
we may, however, charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances
finally, please know that you have the right to make a complaint at any time to your relevant statutory authority
we would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you make a formal complaint,
so please contact us first to see if we can resolve the issue
security the security of your personal information is important to us
our service has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, whether pii or non-pii
at a minimum we follow industry best practices to protect your information, both during transmission and once we receive it, and in many cases we exceed industry standards
unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet, and no method of electronic storage, is 100% secure
that’s another important point… but even though we can’t guarantee absolute data security, we do work to stay ahead of the curve by developing and implementing new and ever-improving security protocols and processes to protect your personal information
cookies a cookie is a chunk of data – typically stored as text file – that is placed on your computer or other device when you visit a particular website
we use cookies to identify your device to our servers when you visit, so the we can load your preferences, automatically accept your credentials, or otherwise personalize your experience
cookies do not store personal information about you, just information identifying your device
in accordance with european union privacy law requirements, amity’s users must consent to have cookies placed on their computers and may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our websites
operating our websites without cookies may cause some features of our websites to not function properly
business transfers if amity, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, we would transfer user information as one of our assets to a third party
as part of this transfer or acquisition, the third party will be required to abide by this privacy policy
scope of this policy this privacy policy applies to amity mobile apps, websites, and other software components (our service)
privacy policy changes we may change this privacy policy from time to time
while changes are expected to be minor, we’ll notify you and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy
your continued use of this site, mobile apps, or services (our service) after any change in this privacy policy constitutes your acceptance of such change
