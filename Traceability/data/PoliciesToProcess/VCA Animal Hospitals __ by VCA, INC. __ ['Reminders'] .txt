what are web beacons and how do we use them
some of the pages of our sites and our emails may contain electronic images called “web beacons” (sometimes known as one-pixel gifs, clear gifs, or pixel tags)
web beacons allow us to count visitors who have viewed our sites, helping to indicate the popularity of the page content
in email messages, promotional materials, and newsletters, web beacons allow us to count how many subscribers have read them, and verifying the address provided, system, and server integrity
web beacons allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our consumers for the purpose of providing more personalized content
what are our policies regarding online internet-based advertising
we support the self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising of the digital advertising alliance in the us and for us consumers
more information about these principles can be found here
advertisements that we place online using interest-based data are expected to be delivered with the advertising option icon to help consumers understand how their data is being collected and used and to provide choices for consumers who want more control
the advertising option icon looks like this
by clicking on the advertising option icon when it appears, you can review information (and follow information) regarding online interest-based advertisements, including who is collecting and using your online data, how you can opt-out from receiving such advertisements, and more
how do we serve advertisements through online interest-based advertising
at times we may display ads both on our sites and on the websites of third parties
when you visit one of our sites or view ads that we serve elsewhere online, you may see different kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results or video ads on web pages
sometimes, these ads are based on the content of the pages on which they appear
other times, these ads are generated by matching the particular ad to your interests as inferred from your online activities that have been collected over time
with interest-based advertising, the goal is to show you ads that are most relevant to you
to do this, we and some of our advertising companies use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to collect information about your interaction with our sites and other third-party websites (“ online data ”)
this online data generally does not identify you to us personally and, typically, it is aggregated with other data to create segments – groups of users and certain general interest categories that we have inferred based on a variety of factors (for example, sports fan)
the online data can include
the webpages, products and services you view and links you click when using our sites and services as well as third-party websites
our emails that you view and links you click on within that email
whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you
demographic or interest data, including general geographic location derived from ip address
the search terms you enter when using certain search services
we and our third-party advertising partners use this online data to paint a more accurate picture of the interests of the audiences with which we interact – including you – so that we can serve ads that are more relevant to those interests
in addition, our third-party advertising partners use this online data for a variety of other purposes, including (a) in conjunction with advertising that appears on our website or other websites, (b) for reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and other interaction with ads and the websites on which they are served, and (c) to measure the effectiveness of web-based and email advertisements
why would you want to receive interest-based ads
consumers like to receive interest-based ads for many different reasons
interest-based ads are helpful because they are more tailored to your particular interests
for example, cat owners may see more ads for cat food and fewer ads for dog grooming services
interest-based ads also are more likely to help you discover new products and services that are actually relevant to you and your interests
for example, dog owners may see an ad about the latest dog-grooming products, whereas cat owners might be more likely to see an ad for the latest feline hairball solution
in short, receiving interest-based ads can help to improve your access to new products, services, and features that are most relevant to you
you also will not see the same ads over and over from us because the number of times you see a particular interest-based ad is limited
by opting-out of interest-based ads, you lose all of these benefits
a note on google analytics — to help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use google analytics advertising features, which you can learn more about and opt-out from here
how can you opt out of receiving interest-based ads from us
if you are no longer interested in receiving interest-based ads from any of our sites, you can opt out by contacting us using the information below
please note, however, that opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads from us online
it simply means that the online ads from us you do see will not be based on your particular interests
depending on where you live, you may be able to access one convenient place to indicate your preferences, including the option to make one “universal” opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities
in the united states, visit this site
in canada, visit this site
in the eu, visit this site
you can also generally opt out of receiving interest-based ads from third party advertisers who are members of the network advertising initiative (“ nai ”) or who follow the digital advertising alliance (“ daa ”) self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the nai website and daa website
when you opt out using these methods, a cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you have opted out of interest-based advertising
if you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again
these websites also provide detailed information about interest-based advertising and tips for managing your online privacy
