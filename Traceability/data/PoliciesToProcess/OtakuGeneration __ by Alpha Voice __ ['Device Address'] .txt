please carefully read this privacy policy as it provides important information about alphavoice’s privacy practices
if you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@alphavoice
(dba alphavoice), a delaware corporation, and its affiliates (collectively, “alphavoice”, “we”, “us” or “our”) are committed to protecting the privacy of information you provide to us
accordingly, alphavoice provides this privacy policy to inform you about our online information practices, the kinds of information we may collect, how we intend to use and share that information, and how you can request access, correction, portability, or deletion of such information (our “privacypolicy”)
all undefined capitalized terms used in this privacy policy have the meaning set forth in the terms of use
“personal information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person
“process” or “processing” means any operation which is performed upon personal information, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction
except where otherwise indicated, this privacy policy applies to individuals who
(a) visit alphavoice’s websites (“websites”)
(b) register to attend alphavoice’s online or offline events (“events”)
(c) use alphavoice’s email delivery platform and related services through the websites (“platform”)
or (d) use any other, present or future, online or offline, programs, services, or offerings of alphavoice (“offerings”) (collectively, the websites, events, platform and offerings constitute the alphavoice “services”)
when we say “customer,” we are referring to the person or entity that is registered with us to use the platform or offerings
when we say “you,” we are referring to customers and/or to some other individual who visits any of our websites or attends or events
alphavoice provides the platform to customers so they may provide information to, market to, and stay in contact with their subscribers and other individuals (“recipients”) through email
when we process personal information of recipients (“recipient personal information”) on behalf of our customers, we process such personal information only as a data processor and in accordance with our customers’ instructions
if you are a recipient of one of our customers, you should review that customer’s privacy policy, terms, or other notices to learn how that customer collects and uses information about you, including through the platform
if a customer has submitted personal information pertaining to you as an individual to us as recipient personal information and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, port, or delete such personal information, please inquire with the applicable customer directly
because alphavoice personnel have limited ability to access recipient personal information, if you wish to make your request directly to alphavoice, please provide the name of the applicable alphavoice customer
we will refer your request to that customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request within the timeframe required by applicable law

disclosure of anonymized information alphavoice reserves the right to use and disclose anonymized information, aggregated information or publicly available information that has not been combined with nonpublic personal information for any purposes including without limitation alphavoice’s internal use and research
however, alphavoice will not disclose information, even in anonymized, aggregate, or derivative forms, that is made available by our connection to email providers such as gmail, including api calls relating to checking, reading, or sending email, in accordance with the additional requirements for restricted scopes as specified by google
when connecting to email providers such as gmail, alphavoice will only make use of the information necessary to render our service so that we can display our user interface and perform requested actions on your account
third-party email account syncing alphavoice allows you to connect our services to your various third-party email accounts (such as gmail) for the purpose of sending email and for us to check your inbox for replies and bounces
we require a small set of permissions on your third-party email account to be able to do this and will only use it for the purpose of providing you with our services or for diagnosing issues related to your third-party email account
alphavoice will not use your email account information for any purpose other than providing the services to you
alphavoice is not responsible for any issues related to your third-party email account
alphavoice’s use of information received from gmail apis will adhere to google's limited use requirements
permissions alphavoice requires “view your email messages and settings” alphavoice will access your basic profile information including photo, name, and email address so that we can properly label your account
alphavoice will periodically check your inbox for messages
our app will check your inbox to find replies to emails sent by your alphavoice campaigns in order to present this information to you within the alphavoice application, turn recipients into leads as necessary, and stop follow-up messages from sending when a reply causes someone to become a lead
we also look for unsubscribe requests and bounces to emails sent by alphavoice to keep your contact lists up to date and help you with deliverability
in rare cases, our engineers may use an internal tool to attempt to locate emails related to your alphavoice campaigns to either resolve a support request you submitted, to solve a bug, or to investigate a potential security issue
this is always done in such a manner that the engineers view the least amount of information possible
“send email on your behalf” alphavoice needs this permission to be able to run your campaigns and send emails to “the reason a narrower scope is not sufficient” in order to run a full email campaign, send emails on your behalf and report back on the effectiveness of those emails
alphavoice needs permission to send emails, and read the emails in your inbox to classify
whether emails bounced, whether individuals asked to unsubscribe, or whether individuals responded in a positive manner
content of emails sent when a customer sends an email to a recipient, it bounces from server to server as it crosses the internet
along the way, server administrators can read what you send
email was not built for sending confidential information and most emails end up in an unencrypted inbox
please do not use the services to send confidential information
sometimes we review the content of our customer’s email campaigns to make sure they comply with our terms of use
to improve that process, we employ software that helps us find email campaigns that may violate our terms of use
our employees or independent contractors may review those particular email campaigns
this benefits all customers who comply with our terms of use because it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps us maintain high deliverability
usage data and aggregate data where permitted by applicable law and subject to the restrictions set forth in our terms of use and/or customer agreements, alphavoice may
and pseudonymously store the email address of a recipient (“recipient email address”)

alphavoice may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, intelligence, and any other legally permissible purpose subject to restrictions as set forth in our terms of use and/or customer agreements

“do not track” do not track (“dnt”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers
dnt is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services
at this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like alphavoice should interpret dnt signals
therefore, alphavoice does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated dnt signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device
alphavoice retains the personal information we receive as described in this privacy policy for as long as you use our services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws

, by displaying a lock, a key or a similar icon), you should assume that the connection is not secure and that third parties will receive the information shared by you and us during that part of the session
