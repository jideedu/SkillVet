information we collect from you

this includes information like your name, address, or email address (or telephone number, credit card or financial account number, or photos of you
) it may be called personal information, personally identifiable information, or “pii
information that relates to you, or to a device you use, but on its own does not identify you
this includes information like about your internet connection and the type of device you use to connect to the services—or even a series of numbers arbitrarily assigned to your device to help us send it content and marketing
this information may also be called “non-pii
within these two categories, we may collect
contact or registration information
you may provide a name, address, email address or telephone number when you enter a contest or sweepstakes
or download a film
updates on a film that will be released, register for a promotional event, or sign up for a newsletter

post online , such as comments you post on a film review, or in a community discussion
we may also offer you the chance to tell us, on our site or on questionnaires we offer on other sites, including social media,
what you think of part or all of our services, for example, a website or app, or one of our movie trailers
this information may be pii, if you post under your real name, and your comments are associated with your name
posting information is voluntary
you may always choose not to provide us with information, but that may limit the features or information you can receive or enjoy
information about you, or your use of other products and services, that we obtain from other sources
we may obtain information such as demographic information (your age and gender for example) from publicly available sources
there may be social media widgets on our pages that help you view or share our movie trailers and other content through your social media accounts
if you do share content on social media services, we may also receive information about your use of those social media services, or information you have published on social media,
that helps us understand your interests
we may combine these types of third-party information, or other information we may license from
third parties, with the information we receive when you use our services
we may use cookies, web beacons (clear gifs) and other such devices (“tracking technology”)
to collect information about your use of the services
the tracking technology that we and our third-party service providers (see more information here) use may include

an ip address is a number assigned to your computer or network when you are on the internet
when you request content through a web site or application, we use the ip address to direct the content to your device, and our servers log the ip address as we do that

if you sign in or provide us with pii from
two different devices, we will know they are linked to you and to each other, but if we use other information to try to associate devices, we may only be able to make assumptions that they are probably linked

we may also use other information about how you access and interact with our services (such as
how often you visit, or the times, dates, and lengths of your visits) (“activity information”) to tailor content and messages to you

we also use information about how you and others use our services to manage content delivery (for example by ensuring you do not see the same information too often), to do market research, to determine which parts of our services are most
interesting and helpful to people, and to improve our products and services, and for other similar purposes
we may use service providers to help us analyze and understand this information so that we can use it effectively
we may also use information to confirm your identity, answer your questions or assist you, and update you

how we protect your information
we use commercially reasonable methods to protect the information we collect
we use measures that are commonly used in our industry to protect data we process from unauthorized access, disclosure or modification
we take industry-standard precautions and follow generally accepted procedures to protect the security of data we process, store and transmit

the use of activity data, including the information about your use and interaction with our services that allows us (through our service providers) to deliver promotional messages to you on other unaffiliated websites, apps, or services, is “interest based advertising,” or “iba
it isn’t possible to opt out of all data collection on all devices
for iba with one action
online data is generally collected through tracking technologies, including cookies, and when you opt out of this data collection, we, or our service providers, store your choice in another cookie on your web browser
if you change devices or browsers, or clear cookies from your browser, you may need to opt out again
this opt out from online tracking for iba will not affect the collection of data from apps on your mobile devices
in order to prevent your activities on a mobile device from being used to track you for iba, you must go to “settings” on a mobile device and turn on “limit ad tracking” for ios devices or “opt out of interest based ads” for android devices
opting out from third party advertising service providers
you can opt-out of third party use of non-pii for interest based advertising by going to those service providers’ own web sites and following instructions in their privacy policies about how to opt out
service providers that collect information through our services for interest based advertising generally participate in the network advertising initiative (“nai”), which provides an opt out tool located at http
org/#/ , and/or the digital advertising alliance (“daa”) self-regulatory program for online behavioral advertising (the ad choices program), which provides an opt out at http
you may also opt out from third-party tracking across apps through the daa’s app choices app
if we or our service providers collect precise location information from an app on a mobile device, we or they will ask you first whether you consent to the collection and use of that information, in accordance with this privacy policy
if you do not want information that our service providers collect on one device to be used for interest based advertising by us or others on other devices, you can opt through the nai or daa opt outs
opting out from one device only removes that device from cross-device advertising
you may still receive ads on other devices that are based on activity data collected on devices you did not remove from cross-device tracking
for example, if you remove your phone from cross-device tracking, data from both your computer and your tablet may still be used to target advertising on and across both of those devices
when you opt out, devices may still be linked by
service providers but that linkage will not be used to deliver cross-device interest based advertising
in addition, if you sign in on any device using your pii, and we know or have stored your preferences or interests, we may use those on all the devices on which you sign in to deliver you relevant promotional messages or content through our own services
you may request access to, and have the right to review, any pii we have collected and retain about you

some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates
because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them
there is disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals
we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and generally accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals
instead, as described above, please see the links
to the network advertising initiative and digital advertising association programs that offer choices about third party tracking across unaffiliated websites and apps
