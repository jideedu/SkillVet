we strive to provide our members, customers, and other users of our website with the best products and services available and recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust
we provide this privacy notice to describe how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we collect
subject to the information provided in this privacy notice, we have structured our site so that, in general, you can visit pmi on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information
once you choose to provide us personal information (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc
) you can be assured that it will only be used to support your member/customer relationship with us, or as otherwise set out in this privacy notice
our membership application process, registration process for seminars, certification and educational programs, the pmi store (marketplace), and job board (career headquarters) may request and/or require you to submit personal information
however, you can be assured that any such personal information that you submit to us will be protected by industry standard security and management procedures and will be used only for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless you request or agree otherwise, or as otherwise set out in this privacy notice
our privacy notice covers these areas
awareness, choice, access & correction, security, additional site issues, international visitors, retention, enforcement contact information, and changes to this notice
pmi provides this privacy notice to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used
what information we collect

in order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences
by using our sites, or by contacting us over the telephone, or through the mail, you may transfer your personal information to locations outside of the jurisdiction in which you live, including to the united states and other jurisdictions in which pmi operates
the provision of information is sometimes required by law and at other times is a result of a contractual requirement
you may be required to provide information, for example in a case where we enter an agreement with you, and the non-provision of information could, in certain circumstances, prevent a transaction from concluding
information collected through technology
when you use any of our sites or services, we or our service providers may collect tracking information such as your browser type, mobile device, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your internet service provider, and pages visited on the sites
we use this information for aggregate reporting
for example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our sites or which pages or features get the most attention
we use this information to make our sites and other products and services more useful to you
to provide you with more effective customer service
to make the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information
to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies
and to display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences

in addition, if at any time you would like to have your name removed from pmi lists and/or directories, please follow the directions given below in the "choice" section (section 2) of this document to opt-out of such contact
we do not use automatic decision-making or engage in profiling that results in legal effects or similarly significant effects on you
where we intend to process your personal information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, we will provide you with information regarding the purpose for the processing, as well as other relevant information, prior to processing your personal information for the new purpose
with whom we share the information
pmi will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others outside of pmi without your permission

such pmi entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by this privacy notice and applicable confidentiality agreements
pmi will not use or share the personal information provided to us for purposes other than for which the information was originally submitted, without your express permission, except as expressly stated in this notice

pmi is committed to ensuring the security of your information
to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online
we use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your sensitive credit or debit card information
we use pci compliant technology to encrypt the connection between you and our systems for the transmission of any credit or debit card information you input online, and we use encryption protection for any payment authorizations for transactions we request through any channel
any unauthorized access to or use of any of our sites and other products and services or to the information collected and maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email at privacy@pmi
org or by writing to us at project management institute, attn

pmi will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email
you should not disclose your user name and password to others
unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure
accordingly, despite our best efforts to protect your personal information, pmi cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services
you transmit all such information at your own risk
however, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems
additional web site issues
how pmi uses technology to improve your site experience
pmi uses cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services
additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your ip address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses
we also deliver advertisements and provide web site analytics tools on non-pmi sites and services, and we may collect information about page views on these third party sites as well
most aggregate information is collected via cookies, web beacons and other technical methods
web beacons (also known as clear gifs), in conjunction with cookies, are used to compile statistics about site usage
web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites or applications
we or our service providers use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our sites and to measure site effectiveness or use of online products and services
we also use web beacons in html e-mails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive e-mail from us, to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails
if you choose to furnish pmi with personally identifiable information, this information can be associated to the data stored in the cookies or web beacons
these technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to our service providers
these technical methods allow us to make our sites and other products and services, and any e-mails you have agreed to receive, more interesting to you
you may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies
we also use cookies to store, and sometimes to track, user information
cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering or subscribing to our sites
a cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive
a cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites to recognize your computer
we use both temporary and persistent cookies
a temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser
we use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit site pages
persistent cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit
